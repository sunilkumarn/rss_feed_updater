We have to identify with the knowledge. It should become a functional practice, and our Supreme refuge. That is the way of sadhana towards eternal peace.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Poojya Swamiji says that the concept of Advaita rises only when, by in-depth introspection, we are not able to find any justification for the objects, space, and changes to be physically or in reality there. The entire world exists. This existence of the world is actually a feeling, a comprehension in our mind. Mind is actually Consciousness, its expression. This Advaita understanding is not to negate and invalidate everything in the world, but not to be deluded by it.

Moksha, i.e. liberation and freedom, the last of the four-fold puruhartha, can be had only through this deeksha. How do we accomplish this attainment? We have to get into our own inner personality.

			<title><![CDATA[Understanding Ego vs. Ahankarah | Words of Wisdom | Swami Nirviseshananda Tirtha]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this short audio, Nutan Swamiji helps us understand the difference between ego and ahankara. While the basic ego is essential — as Swamiji says, it is the hub of our personality, coordinating various functions of the senses, body, and mind — ahankara is different. It refers to the sense of doership and enjoyership that we assign to our activities. We are not responsible for our body, mind, or intelligence; they are all products of nature. It is the false sense of ownership and egoism — ahankara — that leads us into trouble.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[How does Happiness Work? | Words of Wisdom | Swami Nirviseshananda Tirtha]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Nutan Swamiji explains that in meditation, we withdraw from all interactions as well as thoughts about the world, the body, and so on. When we completely forget the external world, we are flooded with happiness and bliss. This experience reveals that true bliss comes from within. Once we understand this truth, we see the fallacy of chasing after happiness. In reality, it is our desires that keep us unhappy. Joy is a natural quality of the Soul, always welling up from within. When all desires (and hatred) are eliminated, we can attain true happiness and permanent joy.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[The Secret to Happiness | Words of Wisdom | Swami Nirviseshananda Tirtha]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>We seek happiness from many sources. In reality, everything we do is aimed at achieving happiness. However, our experiences show that we never attain lasting happiness. If we look around the world, we can easily observe that no one has ever become truly happy by pursuing worldly things, yet we persist in believing, "I will be happy if I do this."

Through the story of young Bhoja, Nutan Swamiji illustrates how futile it is to think we can achieve eternal happiness by gaining anything in this world. Swamiji teaches us that happiness is an expression of the Soul, and it is our desires that obstruct our natural joy. When we eliminate these desires, we automatically find happiness.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this talk, Poojya Swamiji gives spiritual tips to combat depression. It is not correct, he says, to keep thinking of negative qualities one might have. Rather one must try to develop the opposite virtues. Reliance on God, particularly based on a mantra, also instills confidence in a person to accept whatever comes in life and move forward. The same God is present in one’s own being. Thinking thus takes away fear and depressive thoughts.

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;The mind, intelligence, and the ego, are but the functions of the inner consciousness. In Brahmavidya deeksha, Poojya Swamiji explains, we straightaway enter into the inner consciousness plane. It is primarily an inspiration, a divine inspiration the Guru lets loose in you. Swamiji explains the specifics of the Vedantic meditation to be undertaken after the deeksha.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Poojya Swamiji explains the nature of Self-realization. It is not just meditative absorption. 

The realisation of the Self, that is all-pervading, all-permeating, cannot be limited to a realization in the heart. Self-realization is actually a qualitative improvement in the seeker. The quality and character of the mind and intelligence change. The mind becomes purer, the intelligence grows in clarity. That is how the Self-realization becomes more wholesome, static, and relevant.

			<title><![CDATA[The Importance of Austerity - Prabhatha Rashmih | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this talk, Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha highlights how austerity provides all the sublimity, power, purity, tolerance and forebearance to dedicate one’s life wholesomely for the welfare of others. It is the wisdom and austerity alone that leads to an attitudinal change, dedicating one to perform with mental relaxation, delight and an expansive, cheerful attitude.

Swamiji states that this is what the Bhagavad Gita describes as acting in an actionless spirit. Abiding in the spiritual luminosity in the sentience space within, with an enlightened intelligence and dissolved ego, is the austere life lived by Swamiji and the inmates in Narayanashrama Tapovanam. Swamiji further cautions that it is the lack of austerity that leads one to be intolerant, irritated, impatient and other such degrading thoughts and behaviours.

Shlokas chanted in the Track:
मत्कर्मकृन्मत्परमो मद्भक्तः सङ्गवर्जितः ।
निर्वैरः सर्वभूतेषु यः स मामेति पाण्डव ।।
Bhagavad Gita 11.55
सर्वकर्माण्यपि सदा कुर्वाणो मद्‍व्यपाश्रयः ।
मत्प्रसादादवाप्नोति शाश्वतं पदमव्ययम् ।।

			<title><![CDATA[Importance of Satsang - Prabhatha Rashmih | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha in this Talk, emphasises that Narayanashrama Tapovanam is an abode of spiritual knowledge, exclusively oriented to enrich and purify the mind, intelligence and ego.

The Satsang in the Ashram is for Subjective Knowledge, transforming the character, behaviour and interaction by all who apply this Knowledge. This Subjective Knowledge, makes the inner personality free, light, expansive, luminous and joyful. For this, Swamiji quotes the Bhikshu Gita from Srimad Bhagavatam and expounds the depth of the message which on deep reflection and application, transforms the whole being, to the extent that even the environment outside becomes auspicious and divine.

Swamiji himself always speaks about the message and application of the scriptures with wisdom orientation to enrich the seekers and the society at large.

Shlokas chanted in the Track:
नायं जनो मे सुखदुःखहेतुर्न देवतात्मा ग्रहकर्मकालाः।
मनः परं कारणमामनन्ति संसारचक्रं परिवर्तयेद्यत्।।
Śrīmad Bhāgavatam 11.23.42

दानं स्वधर्मो नियमो यमश्च श्रुतं च कर्माणि च सद्व्रतानि ।
सर्वे मनोनिग्रहलक्षणान्ताः परो हि योगो मनसः समाधिः ॥
Srimad Bhagavatam 11.23.45

			<title><![CDATA[Renunciation of Desires is moksha - Prabhatha Rashmih | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In Yoga Vasistha Ramayana, Sage Vasistha enlightens, Sri Rama, that desires are the cause of all bondage. We have latent tendencies and desires coiled up in the mind. Moksha is the extinction of all desires.

Swamiji emphasizes that it is possible for the mind to generate contentment by itself. In reality, there is no place or need for desires. Starting with external things, sannyasins renounce lucrative jobs, blood relations, and more importantly, renounce greed, untruthfulness, possessiveness and ego.

How to renounce the desires of the mind? Aspiration or desire for liberation can be cultivated which will replace desires for external objects. After leaving object desires, the desire for knowing the Self also has to be left.

The secret of spiritual wisdom is that a mind free of desires enjoys supreme peace and contentment.

Shlokas chanted in the Track:

बन्धो हि वासनाबन्धो मोक्षः स्याद् वासनाक्षयः ।
वासनां त्वं परित्यज्य मोक्षार्थित्वमपि त्यज ।।

			<title><![CDATA[The Mind has the Power to Cling and also Leave - Prabhatha Rashmih | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this Talk, Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha discusses the message given by Lord Krishna to Uddhava in the 11th Skanda of Srimad Bhagavatam. Krishna reveals the grand state of renunciation and non-clinging.

Swamiji declares that so long as one is bound to a householder’s life, a person is only half human. It is only the fulfillment of the Sannyasa ashrama, where the quest is exclusively for the Absolute Truth, wanting nothing at all, that the human life is complete. Such a renunciate lets go of everything, never even living for the next day.

Here, Swamiji recounts the grandeur of the great Emperor Rishabhadev, who after giving the sermon on Dharma to his sons, renounced the emperorship and lived in the joyful state of austerity. His mortal body simply merged in Nature by the forest fires. Swamiji describes the glory of such a state of renunciation. The human mind has the inexplicable power to willing leave everything in the world for permanent fulfillment.

			<title><![CDATA[Fixing the Intelligence on God is Austerity - Prabhatha Rashmih | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Swamiji discusses austerity, emphasizing its different levels and forms. Physical austerity involves acts like prostrating before deities, circumambulating temples, and chanting prayers.

Moving beyond the physical, a seeker has to take to austerity of the mind. This includes cultivating positive emotions while eliminating negative ones. Finally, one has to employ the intelligence to ponder on profound questions like the nature of God and the self. By understanding the mind’s workings and recognizing Consciousness as the source of all, true austerity is achieved. Understanding the unity underlying all mental processes is the ultimate goal of austerity.

			<title><![CDATA[Austerity at the level of the Mind and Intelligence - Prabhatha Rashmih | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Speaking about austerity, Swamiji says that Tapas (austerity) can be of three levels. The physical Austerity is the elimination of whatever one otherwise does generally, or incorporation of something new which one is not used to doing as a daily routine. Tapas in the mind level is when one introduces a thought or a set of thoughts and try to revolve them in the mind like mantra japa, thinking of God etc.

Austerity in the intelligence level is when you start contemplating upon God or Self. This is the Austerity where knowledge becomes the goal, knowledge becomes the means, and knowingness becomes the nature! Knowleedge austerity is the highest, noblest level of Austerity. A true seeker, by a process of contemplation, must renounce his possessiveness and ego and reach higher levels of purity.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this track, Swamiji speaks about the important quality of austerity. He says that a seeker must reflect upon and understand what it means and live an austere life.

True austerity should be of the mind, intelligence and heart. In the level of the mind, austerity means, more and more of purity, less and less of impurity. In intelligence level, it should be more and more of the pursuit of spiritual wisdom.

Austerity is either one of denial or one of incorporation. It can relate to the body and senses first; mouth next; mind still next; intelligence still further, and finally it can refer to the ‘I’ or the ego.

			<title><![CDATA[Take to chanting as austerity: Swamiji's childhood practices - Prabhatha Rashmih | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this track, Swamiji shares with his listeners his own love for chanting Sanskrit hymns and shlokas. Right from childhood, the practice of chanting had a purifying and elevating effect on his mind.

Swamiji exhorts everyone to take to the austerity of chanting Vishnusahasranama or Bhagavad Gita. This austerity has its sublime and creative effect on the mind, whereby the mind goes on becoming purified. Various distractional thoughts are gone and their place is taken over by the recitation.

We come to understand from this talk that somehow we need to steal some time for recitation and build up the stock of austerity.

Shlokas chanted in the Track:

आयुर्नश्यति पश्यतां प्रतिदिनं याति क्षयं यौवनं
प्रत्यायान्ति गताः पुनर्नदिवसाः कालो जगद्भक्षकः ।
लक्ष्मीस्तोयतरङ्गभङ्गचपला विद्युच्चलं जीवितं
तस्मान्माम् शरणागतं शरणद त्वं रक्ष रक्षाधुनाम् ।।
Shivaaparadha Kshamapanartha stotram Verse 13

किं वानेन धनेन वाजिकरिभिः प्राप्तेन राज्येन किं
किं वा पुत्रकलत्रमित्रपशुभिर्देहेन गेहेन किम् ।
ज्ञात्वैतत्क्षणभङ्गुरं सपदि रे त्याज्यं मनो दूरतः
स्वात्मार्थं गुरुवाक्यतो भज मन श्रीपार्वतीवल्लभम् ।।

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;In this track, Swamiji shares with his listeners his own love for chanting Sanskrit hymns and shlokas. Right from childhood, the practice of chanting had a purifying and elevating effect on his mind.

Swamiji exhorts everyone to take to the austerity of chanting Vishnusahasranama or Bhagavad Gita. This austerity has its sublime and creative effect on the mind, whereby the mind goes on becoming purified. Various distractional thoughts are gone and their place is taken over by the recitation.

We come to understand from this talk that somehow we need to steal some time for recitation and build up the stock of austerity.

Shlokas chanted in the Track:

आयुर्नश्यति पश्यतां प्रतिदिनं याति क्षयं यौवनं
प्रत्यायान्ति गताः पुनर्नदिवसाः कालो जगद्भक्षकः ।
लक्ष्मीस्तोयतरङ्गभङ्गचपला विद्युच्चलं जीवितं
तस्मान्माम् शरणागतं शरणद त्वं रक्ष रक्षाधुनाम् ।।
Shivaaparadha Kshamapanartha stotram Verse 13

किं वानेन धनेन वाजिकरिभिः प्राप्तेन राज्येन किं
किं वा पुत्रकलत्रमित्रपशुभिर्देहेन गेहेन किम् ।
ज्ञात्वैतत्क्षणभङ्गुरं सपदि रे त्याज्यं मनो दूरतः
स्वात्मार्थं गुरुवाक्यतो भज मन श्रीपार्वतीवल्लभम् ।।
Shivaaparadha Kshamapanartha stotram Verse 12&lt;/p&gt;

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this track, Swamiji emphasizes the importance of Austerity in the life of a seeker. It empowers one to penetrate into the mental and intellectual plane and bring refinement and moderation.

Defining austerity, Swamiji says that Austerity is an effort to bridle, reform and refine the mind and removing all the undesirable elements in it.

Austerity may begin from the sensory, oral and mental level. But the austerity becomes maximum and most central when the intelligence prefers to reflect upon the self and then wants to realize it in its own fullness.

Shlokas chanted in the Track:

संगच्छध्वं संवदध्वं

When these are had, the mind changes its quality, it becomes pure. And as the mind becomes pure, the thoughts, responses and reactions become different. They become purer, more and more sublime, more and more divine.

			<title><![CDATA[Self enrichment through austerity - Prabhatha Rashmih | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this talk, Swamiji emphasizes that the Mind and intelligence can be constantly enriched by austerity. A seeker must ensure that every action he/she performs is done with great attention. One has to constantly analyze whether the action is performed in a pure manner, without any clinging to it.

A seeker needs to ensure that he performs all activities–secular, religious, social– in an austere manner. Swamiji assures us that this sublimation and enrichment of the mind will bring great joy.

Shlokas chanted in the talk:

यज्ञो दानं तपश्चैव पावनानि मनीषिणाम् ॥

कर्तव्यानीति मे पार्थ निश्चितं मतमुत्तमम् ।।

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Poojya Swamiji speaks about the inner and sublime process of renunciation. This renunciation is not meant to be practiced by austere monks alone. It is to be practiced by everyone, in every walk of life.

Swamiji says that real renunciation is the renunciation of Sanga (delusional clinging) to everything. A seeker has to diligently find out where the Sanga, attachment is hiding in his own personality and remove it.

When one practices the inner renouncement, life would be filled with joy, peace, poise and harmony.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this talk, Swamiji says that the body is animated and activated by the power within. The power of animation can be felt only in our living body. Thus, the focus of a seeker must be within. This animating power is the Self, indicated by the term ‘I’. Our shastras are verdicts of the people who have gone into this subject.

A seeker must read the shastras, which are guides and pointers to him and he must never doubt them. He must have a frame of mind that accepts all revelations of the shastras as true, enriching, benevolent, wholesome and endearing. How we receive the shastras is most important. We must read them, learn them and understand and actualize them.

Every statement of the shastras must be considered as pointers. One must delve deeply into the meaning and import of the statements and try to fully understand them. When we see the shastras as the most dependable, caring, endearing revelations, then our progress will be meteoric on this path!

Shlokas Chanted in the Track:

Thus, the focus of a seeker must be within. This animating power is the Self, indicated by the term ‘I’. Our shastras are verdicts of the people who have gone into this subject.

A seeker must read the shastras, which are guides and pointers to him and he must never doubt them. He must have a frame of mind that accepts all revelations of the shastras as true, enriching, benevolent, wholesome and endearing. How we receive the shastras is most important. We must read them, learn them and understand and actualize them.

Every statement of the shastras must be considered as pointers. One must delve deeply into the meaning and import of the statements and try to fully understand them. When we see the shastras as the most dependable, caring, endearing revelations, then our progress will be meteoric on this path!

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Shraddha means assiduous attention and application. Shraddha is extremely important, says Swamiji.

There is no product anywhere in creation which is not made up of the three gunas-Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. The Shraddha that is manifest in the individual – that also will be governed by what kind of a guna is pronounced in him. Through the Srimad Bhagavatam, Swamiji illustrates each of the three gunas working in the individual.

The Sattva Guna is depicted by the 7-year-old boy, Prahlada, whose devotion was unparalleled. Shringi, the son of Shameeka Rishi, displayed Rajo Guna. The moment he came to know of a dead cobra being put around the neck of his meditating father, he pronounced a curse on Pareekshit. The father explained to him that an austere person must be accepting, understanding that the Atma is unaffected, and above the gunas.

Dhruva was blessed with Shastra Tejas and with a spirit and fervor of a fighter i.e. Rajoguna. The Rajoguna had continued to assail him even when he was old. Finally, taking the example of Duryodhana from the Mahabharata, Swamiji gives the example of Tamoguna.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In the entire Srimad Bhagavatam, what is being spoken about is Jnana (Knowledge), says Swamiji. Although it is considered to be devotional text, it only speaks about Bhakti which leads to Virakti (dispassion) and Bhagavat Prabodhah (Realization of God).

In Bhagavatam, Suta muni is asked to explain the essence of all scriptures. He says, “The knowers of Truth say that the essence of all scriptures and allied texts is the Tattva. It is knowledge, that gives no room for a concept of two or Many.The non-dual knowledge is spoken of differently as: 1) Supreme Reality called Brahman or, 2) Paramatma- which we refer to as ‘I’, 3) Bhagavan or the Supreme Lord Almighty.” This is the message of Srimad Bhagavatam – a book on devotion, which actually discusses only the Knowledge and Realization of the Human Mind and Heart.

Swamiji shares the example of Karna, a complex character from Mahabharata. Karna was great, dangerously charitable and courageous. But he also had the hollow aspects in his personality, which Vyasadeva has revealed in his writings. Karna wanted to stand by the side of Duryodhana all along but his intolerance for Bheeshma made him keep away from the battlefield, till Bheeshma fell. It is this emotional turmoil that Vyasadeva has captured in his writings.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Swamiji details how the Epics are not mere historical descriptions, but actually give through them, the values and inspiring lives of all the characters. Ramayana was composed by Sage Valmiki, who got transformed from the dacoit Ratnakara into a saint. Through the close association of the saints, he got free from all his sins. Through the poetic composition of the Ramayana, Sage Valmiki depicts the life of Maryada Purusha Shree Rama as well as all the characters in the kingdom of Ayodhya during the Treta Yuga.

Swamiji speaks about the degradation of this lofty Dharma of our country today. There are malpractices in the temples and other religious worships. Various practices are polluting the minds and the society at large, instead of making people inculcate purity through the devotional practices. In this talk, Swamiji gives a clarion call not to fall a trap to these wrong doings in the name of devotion.

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Swamiji details how the Epics are not mere historical descriptions, but actually give through them, the values and inspiring lives of all the characters. Ramayana was composed by Sage Valmiki, who got transformed from the dacoit Ratnakara into a saint. Through the close association of the saints, he got free from all his sins. Through the poetic composition of the Ramayana, Sage Valmiki depicts the life of Maryada Purusha Shree Rama as well as all the characters in the kingdom of Ayodhya during the Treta Yuga.

Swamiji speaks about the degradation of this lofty Dharma of our country today. There are malpractices in the temples and other religious worships. Various practices are polluting the minds and the society at large, instead of making people inculcate purity through the devotional practices. In this talk, Swamiji gives a clarion call not to fall a trap to these wrong doings in the name of devotion.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this Talk, Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha reveals how Hinduism is extremely rational, whether it is through devotional or logical paths.

Quoting from the supreme devotional text the conversation between Uddhava and Sri Krishna, or the mento-intellectual supreme knowledge regarding Brahman / Self and the world being a display of Consciousness or even the instructions given to Arjuna by Sri Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita, Swamiji highlights that every scripture reveals through deep analysis, the Supreme Truth. This makes devotion and Godly love even more sustained and intense and the devotee with this mento intellectual understanding, drowns in Spiritual ecstasy.

Thus, with several examples, Swamiji clarifies that whether it is devotion or knowledge, the Truth is exposed in the most rational manner, thus removing all confusions, doubts and delusions.

Shlokas chanted in the track:
नासतो विद्यते भावो नाभावो विद्यते सतः ।
Bhagavad Gita 2.16

कात्यायनि महामाये महायोगिन्यधीश्वरि ।
नन्दगोपसुतं देवि पतिं मे कुरु ते नम: ।

			<title><![CDATA[The Essence of Scriptures - Prabhatha Rashmih | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this track, Swamiji urges that we should try to find out the essence of the shastras. We should sift the essence of shastras and hold on to it.

Sukha and dukha are the only 2 experiences the entire world provides. A seeker must never foster a preference to one and prejudice to the other, as they follow each other. This is irresistibly had by us due to our interactions with the world.

Then what are we supposed to do? Become a ‘Nirdvandva’, says Swamiji. Try to rise above both. Take away the preference and prejudice and allow sukha and dukha to be what they are. Then we have taken away the sting from both and we arrive at a level of transcendence.

This is the gist of the entire shastras. All explanations are only confirmations of this basic point. Texts like Bhagavad Gita, Yogavasishtha and other scriptures speak about this.

Shlokas chanted in the Track:

अनन्तशास्त्रं बहुवेदितव्यं स्वल्पश्च कालो बहवश्च विघ्नाः ।
यत्सारभूतं तदुपासितव्यं हंसो यथा क्षीरमिवाम्बुमिश्रम् ।।
Subhashitam

समः शत्रौ च मित्रे च तथा मानापमानयोः ।
शीतोष्णसुखदुःखेषु समः सङ्गविवर्जितः ।।
Bhagavad Gita 12.18

निर्द्वन्द्वो हि महाबाहो सुखं बन्धात्प्रमुच्यते ।।

			<title><![CDATA[Understand the Contrasts in Human Mind Through Mahabharata - Prabhatha Rashmih | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Swamiji speaks on Mahabharata, mainly on the characterization of a few individuals to bring forth an understanding of the human mind and personality.

Our body is a biological aggregate which we look after by food, nourishment and exercise. Our inner personality comprising of the mind and intelligence undergoes all the changes, improvements, enrichments. This inner personality defines our character, behavior and interactions.

Mahabharata discusses the nature of this inner personality, its potential, possibilities, and gives us the history of our predecessors. Swamiji speaks at length about the human mind, its emotions, it’s excellences and being victimized by itself, sharing the story of how the 8th child of Shantanu and Ganga, Bhishma, came to be.

Swamiji marvels at the pen of VedaVyasa which presents many contrasts in the Mahabharata.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[The Relevance of Mahabharata VIII - Prabhatha Rashmih | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this beautiful talk, Swamiji gives the examples of some of the epic characters from Mahabharatam–Draupadi, Arjuna, Bheeshma and Drona. In different times and situations, they had to face intolerable mental challenges and agony.

Spirituality says that whether it is a physical torture or a mental torment there is a way of transcending both. There is something called the way of transcendence, the way of surrender, the way of clarity, the way of impersonal and impartial neutrality. That is called the Soul or God. That is called the wisdom of God and the wisdom of the soul. There everything dissolves.

Citing various examples in and before the Kurukshetra war, Swamiji says that Bhagavad Gita is an answer and a redress and a solution for all kinds of developments in this world– physical, mental, intellectual or otherwise.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Ashtavakra Samhita, is a conversation between King Janaka and Ashtavakra Maharishi. King Janaka asked sage Ashtavakra to enlighten him on Jnana, Mukti and dispassion.

Spirituality is a psycho intellectual science. All panchabhutas are inert but we are sentient. Is the mind the final truth or is it a function of something else? Spirituality takes up this probe. When we take up this probe, we realise that everything around us is changing physically and chemically. Our body-mind personality too is transforming but we have an unchanging ‘I’ within.

Purity of mind and refinement of intelligence lead us to the state of Self-Realization. As we drop desires and possessiveness and have no ego about anything, we become more pure and the self reveals itself to us.

The ‘I’ is within, closer than the mind, intelligence and ego. Sage Ashtavakra presents this in a simple and straightforward manner.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this track, Swamiji emphasizes that spiritual seekers require love, devotion, and association to a living guru to progress in their spiritual practice. The initiation and blessings from a guru holds great importance, as sādhana revolves around the guru’s guidance.

Scriptures, such as the Upanishads and Bhagavad Gita, serve as guides to realizing the truth. However, mere reading of scriptures without realizing the truth is futile. Swamiji highlights on focus on sādhana rather than extensive reading. Overall, love, devotion, association with a guru, and realization through sādhana are deemed crucial in the spiritual journey, alongside the role of scriptures.

Shlokas chanted in the Track:

			<title><![CDATA[Importance of Scriptures in Sadhana - Prabhatha Rashmih | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>The Sadhana of studying scriptures must be diligently practiced by a seeker, says Swamiji. Scriptures speak about devotion, restfulness in God, ephemerality of the world, dispassion, God, Self etc. They discuss how a seeker should do Sadhana to attain his goal. Scriptures throw light on the wholesome pursuit of the seeker.
After reading or listening to the scriptures, one must absorb some of the cardinal points relevant to one’s own sadhana.

Swamiji urges seekers to select and learn fifty verses which would represent their own Sadhana. These verses, once absorbed, would become a permanent wealth and help for the seeker. The verses would help him assess how much he has grown in his spiritual pursuit, what are the qualities to be incorporated, what are the traits to be discarded etc.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[The Impact of Srimad Bhagavatam on The Human Mind - Prabhatha Rashmih | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In Srimad Bhagavatam there are twelve Skandhas, says Swamiji. These twelve skandhas are the raw materials which have to fed into one’s own mind. By the time one comes to the twelfth skandha, all the impurities of the mind are dissolved. The mind becomes beautiful and full of devotion.

In the tenth Skandha, Bhagavatam discusses Sri Krishna’s birth, growth and exploits. The Bhāgavata author found that for the human mind to hold on to, there must be a beautiful and alluring character to hold on to. So, he presented Sri Krishna. Krishna faced a lot of adverse situations in his life but faced everything with a smile and acceptance. In the most conflicting and opposing environments, he did not lose his inner splendor, glory, potential and greatness. Swamiji urges all seekers to follow his example and strengthen and refine their own Mind and intelligence.</p>

Each scriptural narration speaks to the seeker as if it is his/her best friend, teacher or a parent. Hey are the great gift and treasure of mankind. There will be an answer in the scriptural narrations for every question in one’s life. For every need there will be fulfillment in the scriptures.

			<title><![CDATA[The Relevance of Mahabharata VI - Prabhatha Rashmih | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Swamiji in this message speaks about the different Yugas and explains how the decline started in the society.

In Krita Yuga, everyone was happy, contented and fulfilled. But it gradually declined and there was a need for a monarch in Treta Yuga to maintain order and discipline.

In Dvapara Yuga, independent thoughts and aspiration became strong and people took to argumentation and logic. Swamiji gives the example of the Kuru assembly where the Pandavas lost in the game of dice and everyone was given a chance to argue and present their case.

			<title><![CDATA[How Epic Narrations are the Prevailing Influence in Humanity - Prabhatha Rashmih | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this track, Swamiji speaks about our epic narrations–Ramayana and Mahabharata. He says that throughout these epic narrations there is a constant effort to inculcate in the minds of the readers and the listeners a fourfold human objective–Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha.

Personal stories are the prevailing influence in humanity every time. They offer inspiration, ideal, compulsion, persuasion, commitment, dedication, sacrifice and what not. The epics depict stories and show how to deal with any situation.

Shlokas chanted in the Track:

स्त्रीशूद्रद्विजबन्धूनां त्रयी न श्रुतिगोचरा ।
इति भारतमाख्यानं कृपया मुनिना कृतम् ।।

			<title><![CDATA[Inculcate Values from Ramayana - Prabhatha Rashmih | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this short audio, Swamiji points out the two values that one can definitely imbibe from the eternal epic, Ramayana.

“This is my friend, this is not so”, this kind of a divisional approach and attitude is there only in the constricted and narrow minds. For a one of noble conduct, the entire earth is one’s family. One has to consider the whole universe as one’s own family.

The second value is: Motherland and everything about the Motherland is far superior to even the heaven.

Shlokas chanted in the Track:

अयं बन्धुरयं नेति गणना लघुचेतसाम् ।
उदारचरितानां तु वसुधैव कुटुम्बकम् ॥
अपि स्वर्णमयी लङका न मे लक्ष्मण रोचते ।
जननी जन्मभूमिश्च स्वर्गादपि गरीयसी ॥</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Message from the Three Children of Srimad Bhagavatam - Prabhatha Rashmih | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Vedvyasa presents the story of three children in Srimad Bhagavatam. In this track, Swamiji discusses each of these stories and explains what the message is for a seeker.

The first story is of Shameeka Maharishi’s son Shringi who cursed king Pareekshit. Shameeka Maharishi’s response to this curse shows us how to teach the younger generation. The second story is of the little boy Dhruva who is guided by his mother to go to the forest to propitiate Lord Hari. Srimad Bhagavatam, through this story, tells us how to test our own devotion. The third story is of young Prahlada who remained steadfast in his devotion to Sri Hari.

Through these stories, Bhagavatam tells us about the majesty of the human mind. Swamiji exhorts all seekers to absorb all the messages and find out where the correction is needed.

Shlokas chanted in the track:

यत आत्मागुणाश्रयः
(Srimad Bhagavatam-1.18.50)

योऽन्तःप्रविश्य मम वाचमिमां प्रसुप्तां
संजीवयत्यखिलशक्तिधरः स्वधाम्ना ।

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Swamiji speaks about India’s great Spiritual heritage which has been preserved for many generations. Every generation has had dedicated people who mastered it and passed it to the next generation. Even now, there are many ascetics who are involved in the propagation of this eternal knowledge.

When one goes to a Guru who is already in the mission of disseminating spiritual wisdom, then one has to try to do the sādhana in the way of śravaṇa, manana and nididhyāsana and then also be a part of the Guru’s mission.

Swamiji exhorts his disciples to have the feeling that they are also part of this dissemination mission that contributes to the rich culture of the country.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[The Importance of Prasthana Trayam - Prabhatha Rashmih | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this audio, Swamiji discusses the subject of ‘Prasthana Trayam’. The word ‘Prasthāna’ means a voyage in the area or region of knowledge– it is a knowledge voyage. The Upanishads, Brahma Sutras and Bhagavad Gita constitute the ‘Prasthana Traya’. They deal with the knowledge about the mind, intelligence and ego and the character, behavior and interactions of an individual.

‘Prasthāna-trayam’ is the one written record before us which clearly tell us what we are, who we are, how our ancients were, for what did we give the supreme value in life and how that supreme goal was fulfilling in every way and how this becomes the real human quest.

Shlokas chanted in this track:

इहचेदवेदीदथ सत्यमस्ति न चेदिहावेदीन्महती विनष्टिः ।
Kenopanishad 2.5

तस्मादसक्त: सततं कार्यं कर्म समाचर |
असक्तो ह्याचरन्कर्म परमाप्नोति पूरुष: ||

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;In this audio, Swamiji discusses the subject of ‘Prasthana Trayam’. The word ‘Prasthāna’ means a voyage in the area or region of knowledge– it is a knowledge voyage. The Upanishads, Brahma Sutras and Bhagavad Gita constitute the ‘Prasthana Traya’. They deal with the knowledge about the mind, intelligence and ego and the character, behavior and interactions of an individual.

‘Prasthāna-trayam’ is the one written record before us which clearly tell us what we are, who we are, how our ancients were, for what did we give the supreme value in life and how that supreme goal was fulfilling in every way and how this becomes the real human quest.

			<title><![CDATA[Points For Sadhana Day - 7 | Gurupoornima Retreat 2022 | Swamini Ma Gurupriya]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this talk, Ma enlightens the seekers about the captivating composition of Vyasa Deva -Bhagavatam. She explains that the purpose of this beautiful scripture is to give confidence and assurance to the seekers, especially the householders, that the Sadhana can also be following the path of pure and loving Devotion to Lord Sri Hari - Krishna. It can and will lead us to Self-Realization. 

Speaking about the uniqueness of Bhagavatam, Ma tells us that the scripture answers the questions- Who is God? What is devotion? Who is a true devotee? What are the qualities of a devotee? Bhagavatam describes the Lord, His appearance, His features, smile, pranks in such a vivid manner that it invokes a sense of loving devotion in the listener. 

Ma says that the descriptive Shlokas impress upon the Sadhaka’s mind the purity of the Atma. Chanting the shlokas, Ma informs us that constant remembrance of the Lotus feet of Krishna, will evoke deep love for Lord Hari. By this love, one will gain knowledge and will grow in vairagya for the worldly objects. Krishna represents Pure Knowledge, Truth, Bliss, and Purity. 

Ma tells us that simple, selfless, motiveless devotion has the power to dissolve all grief, delusion and fear. Ma reminds us that human birth is not easy to attain.  Having attained this, worship and surrender to the Lord is the way to reach the goal.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Points For Sadhana Day - 6 | Gurupoornima Retreat 2022 | Swamini Ma Gurupriya]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Continuing her discourse on Sadhana, Ma Gurupriya ji calls upon the seekers to constantly keep the goal of Sadhana in mind through all activities and interactions. 

Chanting a verse from Vivekachoodamani, Ma urges the listeners to follow the Guru&#39;s instructions and reflect deeply. Ma stresses on the fact that reflection leads to purification of the mind which will lead to Self-Realization.

Ma exhorts us to understand that the intelligence has to be sharpened through constant Vichara (Introspection). A pure and subtle intelligence will, slowly but surely, take the seeker to his goal. Therefore, says Ma, one must stay connected to the Self throughout the day, through all activities and interactions. &#39;Abhyasa’ or the practice of constant contemplation on the Atma is a must.

Ma highlights the need and importance of self-effort in this journey. This subtle and lofty knowledge requires focussed attention and effort. Inattention has to be avoided. 

Ma explains that to attain the goal one has to, in all earnestness, look within, identify and reject all undesirable traits, the subtle and hidden tendencies and strengthen the virtues.

Ma warns us that the worldly desires are simply waiting to tempt and mislead us. So, one must at all times allow discrimination (Viveka) to keep us focussed on our goal. Ma reassures the seekers that a true Shishya need not fear because Guru Kripa will flow and help his Viveka to be alert and sharp. 

Exhorting the listeners to chant the slokas from the scriptures, Ma tells us how a Self-Realized person acts and interacts in the world. He may be externally doing anything, but he is internally stable, seated in the self and experiencing bliss. If a person has had this experience, will he like to chase after worldly objects anymore, asks Ma.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Points For Sadhana Day - 5 | Gurupoornima Retreat 2022 | Swamini Ma Gurupriya]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this talk, Ma Gurupriya ji reiterates that the goal of Sadhana is Self Realization/ identifying our true nature. All the scriptures and the Gurus have at length described the nature of the Self. Ma says that when one attains this state, one experiences eternal bliss and one becomes expansive, universal and free of all constrictions and limitations.
 
Ma reminds us of the three steps to be followed very diligently in our Sadhana - Sravana, Manana and Nididhyasana. Ma says that Sravana or listening to the Guru&#39;s teachings with one -pointed attention is very important. But, more crucial than listening is to reflect on his teachings (Manana) and meditation on the Truth (Nidhidhyasana). 
 
Ma asks the listeners to assess the obstacles in their own sadhana. Ma highlights the fact that it is our very own tendencies, traits, desires and Gunas which constrict our minds. They create preferences and prejudices and cause immense suffering. 
 
Ma quotes from the scriptures and tells us that a true sadhaka must 1) Do  manana and identify the subtle and hidden desires, attachment and possessiveness and eliminate them. 2) Cultivate virtues of truthfulness, compassion, forbearance, straightforwardness etc. 
 
This alone will make our minds pure and restful, says Ma.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this talk, Ma reiterates that all scriptures reassure the seeker that a Guru unconditionally imparts this lofty knowledge to a qualified Shishya who has intense yearning to know the truth. 
 
The compassionate Guru lights the lamp of knowledge and dispels the darkness of ignorance. The Guru shows the definite path to go across the worldly ocean and instills a sense of fearlessness. 
 
Ma says that to be worthy of this knowledge, the Shishya must also do Sadhana and put in intense self effort. Devotion, steadfastness, meditation on the Self is necessary to actualise this knowledge. 
 
Discussing the subject further, Ma explains that a seeker’s Sadhana involves listening (Shravana), Reflection or introspection (Manana), and Meditation on the Truth (Nididhyasana). Ma highlights the role of listening in spiritual progress. The Shishya, Ma asserts, must be attentive, focussed, wholesome and one-pointed when listening to the Guru&#39;s instructions. He must have a deep longing to know the truth and must ask whatever questions that spring up in his mind. 
 
Ma assures us that the Guru is only too happy to remove the doubts of the Shishya, enlighten him, help him cultivate deep Vairagya and develop Viveka which are the necessary pillars of this Lofty Knowledge.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Points For Sadhana Day - 3 | Gurupoornima Retreat 2022 | Swamini Ma Gurupriya]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this talk, Ma Gurupriya ji helps the listeners to visualise an intense seeker, sitting at the feet of a Guru with an attitude of total surrender. 

Ma discusses the reason why a seeker comes to the Guru&#39;s abode and seeks refuge at the Guru&#39;s feet. He is troubled and tormented by the interactions with the world and he would like to know if there is a way to be free of his fears, doubts, confusion and sorrow.

Ma discusses a verse from Vivekachoodamani where a seeker seeks guidance from the Guru. Chanting this heart-stirring verse, Ma explains that the seeker&#39;s prayer is indeed our prayer. We all want to cross this worldly ocean and be free of all torment and misery. Ma implores the listeners to identify with the sloka and feel the intensity of yearning of the seeker’s heart.

Ma assures us that when a seeker comes and asks for guidance, the Guru immediately instructs the seeker on the way forward. He will instruct that knowledge of the Self which is the remedy for all the suffering in this world. Driven by his own compassion and selflessness, he takes the seeker’s hand and leads him to the abode of fearlessness. By his words of wisdom and guidance, he uplifts the mind of the seeker.

			<title><![CDATA[Points For Sadhana Day - 2 | Gurupoornima Retreat 2022 | Swamini Ma Gurupriya]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Ma Gurupriya ji, in this talk, enlightens the listeners on what makes a seeker &#39;eligible&#39; for spiritual wisdom. 
 
She states very categorically that having realized that life has a higher purpose, one must make a wholehearted effort towards attaining it. One-pointed focus and a deep sense of renunciation are the key ingredients of sadhana. 
 
Ma emphasizes that one must persevere as a Shishya and become fit or eligible to receive this knowledge of the Self. Quoting Shankaracharya, Ma exhorts a seeker to go to a Guru. A Guru alone can lead a seeker forward, enlighten him and establish him in this Truth. 
 
Ma discusses the &#39;Sadhana Chatushtaya’ (four-fold qualities of a seeker) which are described in the scriptures. Explaining them in detail, Ma says that these four-fold qualities are necessary for any seeker who yearns for fulfilment and liberation.

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Ma Gurupriya ji, in this talk, enlightens the listeners on what makes a seeker &amp;#39;eligible&amp;#39; for spiritual wisdom. 
 
She states very categorically that having realized that life has a higher purpose, one must make a wholehearted effort towards attaining it. One-pointed focus and a deep sense of renunciation are the key ingredients of sadhana. 
 
Ma emphasizes that one must persevere as a Shishya and become fit or eligible to receive this knowledge of the Self. Quoting Shankaracharya, Ma exhorts a seeker to go to a Guru. A Guru alone can lead a seeker forward, enlighten him and establish him in this Truth. 
 
Ma discusses the &amp;#39;Sadhana Chatushtaya’ (four-fold qualities of a seeker) which are described in the scriptures. Explaining them in detail, Ma says that these four-fold qualities are necessary for any seeker who yearns for fulfilment and liberation. 
 
Ma warns us against becoming complacent in one’s Sadhana. Ma also highlights the importance of surrendering at the feet of a Guru. The Guru will remove the hindrances in our spiritual path and help us to grow and realize our Atma, says Ma.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Points For Sadhana Day - 1 | Gurupoornima Retreat 2022 | Swamini Ma Gurupriya]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This discourse series by Swamini Ma Gurupriya was part of the Gurupoornima Retreat 2022 program at Narayanashrama Tapovanam, Kerala.
In this talk, Ma draws a seeker’s attention to the all-important spiritual pursuit or Sadhana. 

Sharing the wisdom from various scriptures like Vivekachoodamani, Bhagavatam and the Bhagavad Gita, Ma highlights the fact that human life has a higher purpose - to realize our True identity. And the goal of our Sadhana is to be embraced by this Soul identity. 

Soulfully chanting the verses, Ma tells us that, as Sadhakas, we should feel grateful that we are blessed with three things. a) Having had a human birth which helps us to do Vichara. It enables us to reflect, introspect and ask questions. It also helps us to see the impermanence of the worldly objects and recognise the eternal nature of our Soul within. b) Having a burning desire for liberation. Our Sadhana lies in making this yearning more intense and deeper. c)  Lasty, but most importantly, Ma underlines the fact that we are indeed very fortunate to have a Sadguru in our lives. For, a Guru alone will guide us and give direction to our Sadhana to progress towards our goal- to realize our universal dimension.  

Quoting from the scriptures, Ma reminds us that a wise person should not waste time. He/she should make sincere efforts to understand and realize the Atma -his/her true nature.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Introspect Over Scriptural Statements - Prabhatha Rashmih | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Swamiji reveals how scriptural reading and introspection work on the human personality. Arjuna despite being religious, pious, austere and knowledgeable, crumbled on the battlefield in front of all his elders. This resulted in a dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna, where Krishna enlightened the intelligence of Arjuna.

A seeker must read the Gita, absorb and understand it, think about it and assimilate the whole message by reading and thinking over and over again. That is the true sadhana, a pilgrimage for the mind within the body.

The real sadhana is studying the Gita and reflecting on its messages, doing a mind and intellect sadhana. The real sadhana is only the attitude and objective of the mind and the evaluation of the intelligence. We imbibe purity with more reading and understanding of the Gita verses and this makes us more spatial. Swamiji ends this talk by telling us that we must introspect, evaluate and do a self-verification by reading the scriptures.

			<title><![CDATA[Introspection should be a Corollary of your Activity - Prabhatha Rashmih | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Through this talk, Swamiji throws light on Sadhana and how one can cultivate sufficient inspiration and commitment towards it. The focal point is our Buddhi, which has to become resolute and determined.

Desires and hatred make the mind swing. In desire, one has slipped from the self-concept. When we are in grief, do we ask ourselves why we are having grief, as we are the Self? Such introspection is important. As seekers, we cannot allow our mind to be overtaken by things that we have no control on.

A seeker’s mind must be constantly given to Vichara. One must introspect, even while doing physical activity. Self-reflection should be a corollary of whatever we do. One must observe the agitation within, dissolving it in the mind. Introspection must be truthful and infusional and the agitation should be lessened and finally dissolved by this introspection. When faced with an unpleasant situation, when in grief, we must not allow the mind to become cheerless and heavy. We must keep the mind cheerful through introspection.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this talk, Swamiji urges us to recognize that as humans we are mental beings and not just physical beings. The Sentient Consciousness animates and activates the body, mind, intelligence and ego. So, the whole focus should be on the mind, which is the functional display of the Consciousness.

Recognizing the supremacy of the mind, a seeker must love, imbibe and dedicatedly pursue the qualities with fervor, zeal and yearning, to make the mind good, noble, benevolent, enriched, elevated and expansive.

Swamiji exhorts seekers to spend at least fifty mind hours to nurture the qualities. This empowerment of the mind can be developed by Truthful Introspection – Manana. With such a qualitative mind, all interactions by word, thought and deed would be very benevolent and enriching. This Spirituality can be practiced by anybody, focusing on one’s own mind and nurturing qualitative embellishments.

			<title><![CDATA[How to Retain Knowledge - Prabhatha Rashmih | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Through Vivekachudamani, Swamiji explains how despite gaining the Knowledge of the Self, latent desires are sometimes there in a human. When the desires are very strong, it can lead man astray.

We find that life in this world is binding and afflicting, but what binds and afflicts is our strong sense of doership, enjoyership and sufferership. This Ego-centric feeling which grips us, is responsible for the continuation of worldliness. This lingering effect of doership and enjoyership on the mind, can be overcome only by an effort of the mind. By constant and consistent practice of contemplating on the unaffected, unconditional, blissful nature of the Self, rubbing this thought against the existing affliction, one can weaken the strong hold of the feeling of doership and enjoyership.

By Vichara, slowly the feeling of doership and enjoyership will become weak and make the seeker a happy and contented person. Swamiji exhorts all seekers to spend mind hours to bring about a transformation in the thinking.

			<title><![CDATA[The Source of Creation - Prabhatha Rashmih | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>When Arjuna crumbled in the battlefield, refusing to fight, Sri Krishna made Arjuna introspect over grief. He empowered Arjuna’s mind by speaking about the Self which is unborn and undying, which is ever-present, never absent.

Our senses interact with objects and there are two outcomes of interactions in the mind level–Sukha and Duhkha. They cannot be avoided; they are inevitable. A seeker must forbear them.

A seeker treading the spiritual path, must introspect on the source of creation. From the grossest to the subtlest, all things in the world are formful. In Bhagavad Gita, Sri Krishna speaks about the non-dual singular presence and the manifest creation of the world. A seeker must make both these the subject of his enquiry.

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;When Arjuna crumbled in the battlefield, refusing to fight, Sri Krishna made Arjuna introspect over grief. He empowered Arjuna’s mind by speaking about the Self which is unborn and undying, which is ever-present, never absent.

Our senses interact with objects and there are two outcomes of interactions in the mind level–Sukha and Duhkha. They cannot be avoided; they are inevitable. A seeker must forbear them.

A seeker treading the spiritual path, must introspect on the source of creation. From the grossest to the subtlest, all things in the world are formful. In Bhagavad Gita, Sri Krishna speaks about the non-dual singular presence and the manifest creation of the world. A seeker must make both these the subject of his enquiry.

			<title><![CDATA[A Pursuit of Knowledge - Prabhatha Rashmih | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Swamiji, through this talk, compels us to reflect deeply on the pursuit of Knowledge. Just as the body and senses are employed in our life, our mind and intelligence are also employed. The delusion, which is there in the mind and intelligence, has to be removed by the pursuit of knowledge. The knowledge pursuit is far greater than sensory and oral pursuits.

A seeker must cultivate the habit of sensory regulation in Jnana Sadhana. The seeker must cultivate noble virtues to bring about purity of mind. The intelligence must be purified by constant reflection on the Subject.

Knowledge alone is the greatest mentor and influencer. Through introspection alone can one purify of mind and intelligence and regulate the senses. When it is done, the spiritual path becomes the best and most rewarding.

			<title><![CDATA[Right Introspection - Prabhatha Rashmih | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Swamiji urges us to do the right kind of Introspection, constantly being aware of the mind. One must reflect whether it is overshadowed by either desire, hatred or fear. Only with the right kind of Introspection can the mind become absolutely free of desire, hatred or fear.

Through interpersonal relationships, the mind comes out with its inadequacies, irregularities and defects. Being aware &amp; attentive, one should go into the mind and find out if it is behaving properly or not and bring about the necessary correction. This is the introspection which can be done in any situation, anywhere and at any time. By introspection, the mind gets corrected and is treated beautifully. It can achieve any level of purity and goodness so that one can be happy. Every tiny fractional improvement will make the mind more joyous.

			<title><![CDATA[Spirituality - A Compulsive Pursuit to Enrich Your Inner Personality - Prabhatha Rashmih | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this talk, Swamiji discusses spirituality and meditation. The human body is an instrument in the hands of the mind and intelligence. Because our mind, intelligence and ego are spiritual, spirituality becomes an indispensable subject for everyone. Spirituality is the science and art of enriching, empowering, elevating and expanding one’s own mind and intelligence.

The purpose of meditation, and its allied practices, is to understand the mind and intelligence and make it better, make the intelligence do its task of introspection, and through introspection set right all problems of the mind and find solutions for all. When introspection deals with the mind, with a view to dissolve the problems, then it becomes a sadhana.

The highest form of human austerity is Truthful Introspection or infusional introspection. The purpose is to infuse into oneself qualities related to attitudes, responses and performance. One must have the quality of exclusiveness and dedication to every task that has to be performed. One must be loving, considerate and sacrificing for the sake of others. One must be free of the sense of doership, pride and ego. In the intelligence level, one must have clarity of understanding, wisdom. Spiritual pursuit is where one constantly strives to enrich the mind and intelligence.

			<title><![CDATA[The Truth about the World - Prabhatha Rashmih | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In Yoga Vasistha Ramayana, sage Vasishtha says that the entire grossness and solidity that the world appears to present, is not a reality; it is only a myth. The wakefulness, along with the objective universe, disappears in sleep. The whole scenario is within the body. The solidity or grossness attributed to the world objects is not true.

The subject-object distinctions totally disappear in sleep. Like they are disappearing in sleep, in wakefulness also when one starts spiritually introspecting over the truth of substances, there comes a time when the solidity and solid objects completely prove fallacious.

Sage Vasistha says that in the transcendental level, there is neither the world nor the soul different from it; neither the body nor the soul different from it, neither the object nor the subject different from it. In the Supreme state, there is no creation and no dissolution; there is no bondage and no one striving for liberation.

			<title><![CDATA[Enquiry into the Self Alone is Devotion - Prabhatha Rashmih | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Swamiji says that Bhakti or devotion is a development in the inner personality of man. Devotion is something which rests completely in the mind. So, unless a devotee takes up introspection, devotion is not going to increase.

Enquiry into the Self alone will give true shape to one’s devotion. One must enquire into the Self, understanding that God is no other than the synonym of the Self.

The inner presence (which we refer to as ‘I’) is the unforgettable presence within. That presence is really God. A devotee cannot forget Him or get distanced from Him. A devotee will be able to understand this, provided he introspects on this using the mind. For this, the vicāra part has to be installed and preserved and strengthened.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this talk, Swamiji, enlightens us about knowledge and the whole structure and treasure of knowledge.
Existence and knowledge can be divided into two categories- Object knowledge (bodily and external) and Subject knowledge (mind and internal)

There are three categories of knowledge–Pratyaksha (object knowledge gained by the senses), Paroksha (knowledge we get about the factors within the body. Here the mind and intelligence are used to infer things), Aparoksha (neither the senses nor the mind and intelligence work. This knowledge is called direct perception, direct realization!)

A seeker must take to meditation and introspect using the mind and intelligence, until at last, he shuts his own mind and intelligence also. Then, whatever experience he will have, will be of the ‘I’. I’ is the subject in us. It is the subject, not merely in our individual personality, it is equally the subject of the entire universe.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Swamiji says that Vichara is a process, a pursuit, a habit, a discipline, a powerful medicine, for the long-standing disease of worldliness. A seeker must spend sufficient time in doing Introspection.

Everyone suffers by the impacts of the world. The focus of a seeker must be to make the impacts light and dissolve them. One has to imbue into the mind such thoughts, introspection and inputs, by dint of which, the impact from the world loses its effect.

By activating Vichara, all the insufficiencies of the mind can be completely remedied, and a sense of abundance and affluence will start gracing the mind. By having the inner sufficiency, one can overwhelm all external situations.

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Swamiji says that Vichara is a process, a pursuit, a habit, a discipline, a powerful medicine, for the long-standing disease of worldliness. A seeker must spend sufficient time in doing Introspection.

Everyone suffers by the impacts of the world. The focus of a seeker must be to make the impacts light and dissolve them. One has to imbue into the mind such thoughts, introspection and inputs, by dint of which, the impact from the world loses its effect.

By activating Vichara, all the insufficiencies of the mind can be completely remedied, and a sense of abundance and affluence will start gracing the mind. By having the inner sufficiency, one can overwhelm all external situations.

Shlokas chanted in the Track:

दीर्घसंसाररोगस्य विचारो हि महौषधम् ।।
(Yogavasishtha, Mumukshu-Vyavahāra-Prakaraṇam 14.2)

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Swamiji enlightens us about a conversation between King Sikhidhwaja and his wife Choodala in Yoga Vasishtha Ramayana. Choodala, a Self-Realized knower, believes that the spiritual goal can be attained by Vichara. Sikhidhvaja believes the goal is only attained by hard austerity and goes away for many years to the forest to perform austerities.

After years, through a conversation, Choodala is able to bring home to him that external renunciation has nothing at all in terms of substance and purpose. Renunciation has to be inner and ultimately it has to be of one’s very mind,

Swamiji condenses the dialogue and pronounces that mind is not gross or perceptible entity. It is experiential and expressive. By infusional introspection alone, the mind can be purified. So infusional, noble, spiritual, thoughts have to be infused in the mind to be purified. By Tattva Vichara alone, one can improve one’s spiritual, devotional and religious life.

The intelligence should do truthful introspection, introspection in which truthful elements are sought, employed and understood. The intelligence is the one factor which can influence the mind. The mind can be strengthened and properly guided by the intelligence.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha, in this Talk, speaks of the supremacy and excellence of the human intelligence and describes Truthful Introspection as the highest human activity.

Vichara shapes the character, behavior and interactions of a human being. This art of thinking, where the intelligence is directed rightly through introspection alone, will not allow the mind to host unwanted thoughts and the ego will assert its imperishable dimension. It is only because of lack of introspection that one does not progress on the path of devotion and also does not gain spiritual fulfillment.

It is only through the simple path of introspection, that the intelligence can delve into deep reflections about oneself, world, God and thus discover the source of Supreme joy and fulfillment. Swamiji states that it is only by the process of Truthful Introspection, Tattva Vichara, that the Vedas were composed, Maharishi Valmiki composed the Ramayana and Sage Vyasadeva the Mahabharatam.

Without challenging situations, the mind cannot expand or ascend to higher dimensions to assimilate the experience.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Nutan Swamiji explains that there is often confusion between religious and spiritual concepts among a vast majority of people. Not everyone will be able to understand the subtle truth, and many may not even care for it at all. Religion defines a general code to guide society and keep it on a moral track. It is based on beliefs such as the rebirth of the soul, heaven and hell, and the theory of karma. By asserting the existence of the Atma, which transcends the body, it provides an opportunity for people to inquire about what this Atma is, what is its nature and whether it goes anywhere, etc.

However, when we delve into spirituality, we encounter difficulty in disentangling ourselves from these religious concepts, which makes it challenging to grasp subtle truths like the Atma and Brahman. Therefore, to comprehend these lofty and subtle spiritual truths, it is essential that we transcend religious concepts and embrace the higher levels of abstraction and truths proclaimed in the Upanishads.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>How spirituality has to be pursued, its effects, why people do not pursue it are some of the questions Swamiji poses and answers in this beautiful talk.

Vichaara is truthful introspection in which only the mind and intelligence are at work. In meditation all thoughts are dissolved but in vichara they are vibrant and we reflect upon them. Going into the mind, making the vichara intense and sharp, the intelligence perceives the supreme truth. Introspection on the Subject is a process where the mind and intelligence are alone involved to discover and verify what the mind, meditation, ego are and what is beyond all this! Swamiji urges seekers to get focused on Vichara and understand what happens when Vichara is done.

The mind breeds desires and impurities like anger, fear, jealousy, possessiveness, ego, desires etc. One has to cultivate the right way of thinking and work on all the negative traits of the personality. A Sadhaka needs to introspect on the possibility of living in this world desire free and free of ego and possessiveness.

Meditation is only a precursor to contentment and peace in the mind. It is our interactions and their effects on the mind pre and post meditation, that need to be introspected upon constantly.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this track, Swamiji exhorts seekers to take to the austerity of spending time devotionally, piously and with attunement with whatever he/she reads and try to understand it. Knowledge is a great austerity. It helps the seeker in bringing about sublimation, correction, fulfillment and refinement in his personality.

Knowledge is the deepest faculty and constituent in the human personality. Mundakopanishad says that Knowledge austerity is the process by which the Brahman started growing and becoming matter, energy, force, senses, mind, intelligence and ego.

			<title><![CDATA[Mantra Japa to Tackle the Mind II - Prabhatha Rashmih | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this talk, Swamiji says that it is the consciousness that has formulated our body, shaped our senses, imbued them with their respective powers and it is through these senses that the consciousness extends itself to become the infinite, endless world of variety.

The first access we have to the consciousness is through the mind. Once a seeker understands that mind is the fulcrum in his Sadhana, the mind has to sublimate desire, hatred and fear which cause a lot of torment and trouble.

How to access the mind? One has to take a mantra and start chanting it mentally. When one mentally chants a mantra, one is in the mind. After the mind arena, the seeker must progress to the intelligence arena where through a process of introspection he comes closer to the Self.

Shlokas chanted in the Track:

बहवो ज्ञानतपसा पूता मद्भावमागता: ।।
Bhagavad Gita 4.10</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this short message, Swamiji categorically states that a spiritual aspirant must introspect on whether his own Sadhana is wholesome. Introspection is an inner mental process which is most essential pursuit for a seeker of Truth.

It is only by a process of constant introspection that a seeker can realize the Ultimate Truth. Manana (introspection) is the greatest worship, the greatest tapasya and the greatest yoga. Swamiji exhorts all seekers to take to the sadhana of introspection which alone makes the sadhana wholesome.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Swamiji, in this track, emphasizes the significance of Tattva-Manana in the life of a seeker. Tattva Manana means deliberation within oneself by engaging the mind and intelligence. It is the practice by which one cultivates desirable qualities and eliminates undesirable qualities.

Introspection is the only way to understand one’s own inner personality. Swamiji stresses that our mind and intelligence are very resourceful. With their help we can transform every negative situation into a positive one.

			<title><![CDATA[Purity through Infusional Introspection - Prabhatha Rashmih | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In spirituality, the introspection is on the mind and intelligence themselves with a view to making them more and more qualitative, reformed, refined, and cultured, says Swamiji. Everyone should develop a habit of generating a dialogue between their intelligence and the mind with a view to infuse the benefits into the mind’s structure and the mind’s activities.

A seeker must develop the habit of making the mind pure, noble and stable. One should become a knowledge-oriented person. Whatever we do, speak or think should be good.

Swamiji exhorts everyone to take to infusional introspection which is an Introspection done with a view to infuse benefits into the mind.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Poojya Swamiji, in this talk, states emphatically that every seeker must take to the habit of introspection. Whatever is read or heard, one must take to thinking deeply about it.

Introspection can be about the nature of the world, our life and one’s own personality. Swamiji urges seekers to take verses from scriptures and introspect over them till the concept becomes clear in their own minds. He asks all seekers to understand the place and importance of Manana or introspection in their life of spiritual seeking.

			<title><![CDATA[Thinking is the Sadhana - Prabhatha Rashmih | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Poojya Swamiji speaks about the importance of ‘thinking’ or ‘Introspection’ for a seeker. Repeated thinking over a concept is a great Sadhana which has a direct impact on the mind. Whenever you come across a concept, you keep revolving it in your mind until you become that.

Swamiji stresses on the fact that a seeker misses the Truth only because he does not take well to the Sadhana of introspection. ‘Repeated thinking’ itself is Sadhana.

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;One must take to the jnana-drishti and judge matters on the basis of spiritual wisdom alone. Any experience is inner and subjective. Based on the fact that something is experienced in the sentient mind as a sentient note, is not the entire world simply Brahman, and not a matter-energy aggregate? Swamiji explains.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>For any seeker pursuing spirituality, it is imperative to introspect over and discern the Spiritual Truth, the presence &#39;I&#39;, which is different from the Pancha Bhutas, but yet which acts on them. At the same time observe and comprehend the external truth - the sun, moon and the world. Everything external is transitory. So, a seeker has to leave all of them and then identity with and become the &#39;I&#39;. 

Swamiji says that it is a voyage in wisdom. One who is inspired by it should become an ascetic and totally depend on chance and providence. This knowledge is not intellectual, but experiential. It leads the seeker to a wonderful state of fulfilment.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Sadhana can be done in the physical level - going to a temple and praying in front of a deity; in the oral level - singing and chanting; and in the mental level - thinking about and repeating a mantra.

But when it comes to Intelligential Sadhana it is very different from all of these. Here, the whole focus is on intense introspection to comprehend the ultimate Truth, the all-fold presence. Through this process of introspection, one has to gain necessary purity, serenity, humility and expanse of mind, and sharpness of intelligence to understand the subtle concepts. When the comprehension finally becomes personal and experiential, we become the Self, the Brahman and we have our inherence in Brahman.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Poojya Swamiji describes his sadhana in the pre-sannyasa life, his meeting with Baba and how the &#39;deeksha&#39; (initiation) propelled his spiritual journey to its beautiful culmination. Swamiji had overwhelming measure of Gurubhakti and earnestness towards the sadhana. This was also complemented by an intense scriptural reading and exposure. 

Swamiji also enlightens us that meditation and the experience of meditation itself is not the be all and end all of spirituality. Spirituality has to be a complement to our life. The final goal is Knowledge, it is the Knowledge about the &#39;I&#39;. It can only be experienced and felt. The truth that I am &#39;I&#39; always is to be deeply comprehended.

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Poojya Swamiji describes his sadhana in the pre-sannyasa life, his meeting with Baba and how the &amp;#39;deeksha&amp;#39; (initiation) propelled his spiritual journey to its beautiful culmination. Swamiji had overwhelming measure of Gurubhakti and earnestness towards the sadhana. This was also complemented by an intense scriptural reading and exposure. 

Swamiji also enlightens us that meditation and the experience of meditation itself is not the be all and end all of spirituality. Spirituality has to be a complement to our life. The final goal is Knowledge, it is the Knowledge about the &amp;#39;I&amp;#39;. It can only be experienced and felt. The truth that I am &amp;#39;I&amp;#39; always is to be deeply comprehended.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In his profound elucidation of Bhagavad Gita&#39;s verse 5.17, Poojya Swamiji expounds on the journey towards Truth. Upon receiving wisdom from the enlightened, our quest transcends mere awareness; it evolves into understanding, a deep internalization of Truth. Yet, this journey doesn&#39;t culminate in passive recognition; rather, it beckons us to embrace Truth ardently, allowing it to illuminate and shape our lives. As we nurture this flame of wisdom within, the impurities of our mind dissolve, and the constraints of our intellect loosen their grip.

Through this inner metamorphosis, a radiant clarity pervades our being. Knowledge flows effortlessly, and we undergo a continual refinement in the crucible of wisdom. Ultimately, the crux lies in our willingness to honor the discernments of our intellect and be governed by it.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Uddhava Gita, in the 11th Skandha of Srimad Bhagavatam, is the subject of discussion in this track. When Uddhava hears of Sri Krishna’s impending departure from the world, he confesses that he would be unable to bear separation from Krishna even for a second. In response, Sri Krishna imparts Knowledge which enables Uddhava to resolve the problems of his mind and get clarity and fulfilment.

Swamiji says that our body is only a temporary tenure, embodiment. We will have to leave the body one day or the other. That leaving should be a fulfilled one and a fulfilling one. The entire Srimad Bhagavatam leads us to this understanding.

Slokas chanted in the track:

नाहं तवांघ्रिकमलं क्षणार्धमपि केशव ।
त्यक्तुं समुत्सहे नाथ स्वधाम नयमामपि ।।

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this audio, Poojya Swamiji speaks about the influence of Poetry in his life of seeking. It helped him remember the verses and reflect upon their meaning and significance. Poetic verses gave him the inspiration to reflect and contemplate on the Supreme Truth.

Swamiji tells the listeners that the poetic verses stay in one’s memory and continue to inspire. He urges seekers to learn scriptural verses so that they become an operational force in the mind. Repeated repetition of the verses helps one cultivate qualities of the mind and intelligence.

Shlokas chanted in this talk:

वासनाक्षयविज्ञानमनोनाशा महामते ।
समकालं चिराभ्यस्ता भवन्ति फलदा मुने ।।

(Yogavasishta Ramayanam, Upasama Prakaranam – 5.92.17)

आनन्दं ब्रह्मणो विद्वान् । न बिभेति कुतश्चनेति ।


(Taittiriya Upanishad 2.9)

चित्तस्य शुद्धये कर्म न तु वस्तूपलब्धये ।
वस्तुसिद्धिर्विचारेण न किंचित्कर्मकोटिभिः ।।

(Vivekachudamani 11)

कोऽहं कथमिदं जातं को वै कर्ताऽस्य विद्यते ।

They are intended to transform the personality of a reader and bring in, as Swamiji says, a characteral elegance, benahvioural majesty and interactional excellence into the personality. The Bhagavad Gita consists of words spoken by Krishna to raise an enervated warrior to his feet. Is it a religious gospel? No, it is a personality transforming scripture, Swamiji explains.

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Our cultural heritage in the form of the scriptures contain accounts of impeccable human character and effective behaviour. They are intended to transform the personality of a reader and bring in, as Swamiji says, a characteral elegance, benahvioural majesty and interactional excellence into the personality. The Bhagavad Gita consists of words spoken by Krishna to raise an enervated warrior to his feet. Is it a religious gospel? No, it is a personality transforming scripture, Swamiji explains.

Our inherent nature has both desirable and undesirable qualities. As we interact with the world, we recognize both and the shastras also help us understand this.

Once we recognize the undesirable within us, we must work to eliminate them. The pursuit of life is to incorporate desirable and eliminate the undesirable. Swamiji asks us to spend sufficient mind hours on each quality, so that it becomes part of us. Mind should be applied so that the quality becomes part of us. 50 mind hours are required to imbibe any quality. The mind must be embossed with the quality and gradually it will be embellished with the quality.</p>

Devotion is centered in the mind. Pujas and ceremonies are not what we need to do. A seeker must offer this mind and intelligence to the Lord.

He must develop an attitude of adjustment, affinity and appreciation with all the creatures of the universe. A seeker must pay attention to the quality of his mind.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this talk, Swamiji says that it is very important for a seeker to cultivate qualities which will guide him forward in the spiritual path. When qualities start adorning the mind, spiritual wisdom becomes meaningful and relevant.

The Sadhana is to develop qualities like Patience, forbearance, equalness in all situations, straightforwardness, innocence, tolerance, compassion etc.

These qualities alone will enable one to experience the majesty, magnificence and ecstasy and serenity of spiritual wisdom.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this message, Swamiji speaks about the qualities mentioned in the thirteenth chapter. A seeker has to assess his own personality, its merits, demerits, the desirables and the undesirables, eliminating the undesirable, installing or incorporating the desirable. It is a sādhanā that is done in the sensory, oral, mental levels and the intelligence levels.

A seeker must make sure that he practices external and internal purity. He should live, act, move, talk and think in such a manner that it has a purifying effect on himself. In the matter of understanding the self, gaining the necessary knowledge and realization, and becoming a jeevanmukta, the close association with the Sadguru is inevitable. A seeker must also have stability in his sādhanā, he must be unwavering, unshakeable, unassailable in his pursuit.

Shlokas chanted in the Track:

अमानित्वमदम्भित्वमहिंसा क्षान्तिरार्जवम् ।
आचार्योपासनं शौचं स्थैर्यमात्मविनिग्रहः ।।
(Bhagavad Gita 13.8)</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this track, Poojya Swamiji warns seekers against having excessive attachment to the body. Our body is completely grown by the age of 21. After that, the qualities which are to be developed by us are only in the inner personality. We can develop them till the end of our life.

We are born in this world to imbibe good qualities, to be amiable and to be benevolent. Any good quality will make one dear to the others. One will be happy and contented in the hands of good qualities and the others around will also be happy to see our good qualities.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Purity is an essential quality for a seeker, says Swamiji. A seeker should have a pure mind and intelligence. One must have a healthy, flexible and sensitive mind, so that it will be able to employ the body and the bodily parts efficiently in a very effective manner.

Ultimately, the purity of the mind is when a mind not darkened with desire. Mind should also be free from possessiveness, hatred and ego. The intelligence becomes pure, when it is given to probing into the truth.

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;How do we cultivate attention? What are the inner values that make us attentive to the work we do or are made to do? This is a very important question since it is mainly attention which impacts the performance. Swamiji goes into the factors that determine the degree of attention.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>How is it that in ancient India, almost all treatises, whether in the field of science, mathematics, medicine, or literature, even dictionaries, were composed in poetry? Swamiji explains the benefits of reading poetry, how it re-organizes the mind and instills the qualities we want. One may not have the qualities initially, but chanting the poetry produces the joy equal to the attainment. Isn’t it a wonderful vehicle for transformation?

			<title><![CDATA[Science Behind Temple And Prana Prathishta | Words of Wisdom | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Poojya Swamiji enlightens us that there is a lot of science behind temples, installation of deity and deity worship. God is an all pervading presence, yet it is very difficult for most people to think or visualize his Omnipresence. So, the Priest who installs the idol, implores God to come and be present in the idol. He instills the force and power of Prana into the stone. 

The air is present everywhere, yet we can only breathe it. It does not immediately help relieve us of the heat or sweating of the body. But when we use a handfan to blow the air, we get a sooting effect. The air becomes functional. In the same manner, when the idol is consecrated, people will have a focus there and will be able to come and pray to God by looking at the idol.

			<title><![CDATA[Renunciation is of the Mind - Prabhatha Rashmih | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Bhagavad Gita speaks about Renunciation. Tyaga and Sannyasa are the main two subjects of the Bhagavad Gita. The questions thus arises as to how to accomplish this Tyaga and Sannyasa? How does it reflect in our Interactions? Can Interactional Sadhana accomplish it?

The entire world is designed by God, preserved by God. We play no part in it. But we still feel a sense of doership and enjoyership. A seeker must completely abandon the feeling of doership, enjoyership and sufferership. When all the activities performed are renounced attitudinally by the mind, it becomes the yoga for the buddhi.

A seeker must introspect about God who has created and preserved everything and wholesomely surrender to the Lord. Sri Krishna says: “Mentally renouncing all actions to Me (the Supreme), regarding Me as the Supreme, let your mind, resorting to Buddhi Yoga (anchoring the intelligence in the Inmost Reality), abide constantly in Me.”

Shlokas chanted in the Track:

			<title><![CDATA[Renunciation is of the Mind - Prabhatha Rashmih | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Bhagavad Gita speaks about Renunciation. Tyaga and Sannyasa are the main two subjects of the Bhagavad Gita. The questions thus arises as to how to accomplish this Tyaga and Sannyasa? How does it reflect in our Interactions? Can Interactional Sadhana accomplish it?

The entire world is designed by God, preserved by God. We play no part in it. But we still feel a sense of doership and enjoyership. A seeker must completely abandon the feeling of doership, enjoyership and sufferership. When all the activities performed are renounced attitudinally by the mind, it becomes the yoga for the buddhi.

A seeker must introspect about God who has created and preserved everything and wholesomely surrender to the Lord. Sri Krishna says: “Mentally renouncing all actions to Me (the Supreme), regarding Me as the Supreme, let your mind, resorting to Buddhi Yoga (anchoring the intelligence in the Inmost Reality), abide constantly in Me.”

Shlokas chanted in the Track:

चेतसा सर्वकर्माणि मयि संन्यस्य मत्परः ।
बुद्धियोगमुपाश्रित्य मच्चित्तः सततं भव ॥
Bhagavad Gita 18.57

			<title><![CDATA[Every Exhortation in Bhagavad Gita relates to the Mind and Intelligence - Prabhatha Rashmih | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Discussing some verses from the Bhagavad Gita, Swamiji discusses Yoga in great depth and detail.

We interact with the world and everything that follows is an outcome of interactions.The sense organs on their own do not have the power to function, without the guidance of the mind. So, our entire life is based on the mind. This mind can be acted upon only by the intelligence which has knowledge as the quest.

Our entire life is an expression and extension of the mind, and all our problems are mind problems, which can be resolved by the intelligence alone. Our intelligence must generate whatever is needed to enrich and empower the mind consistently. This conjugation between mind and intelligence is what is termed as Yoga. Yoga is never external, nor sensory and physical. It is always inner, bearing upon the mind and intelligence.

Krishna also discusses Bhakti as a Yoga, which is based upon the mind and intelligence. A true devotee is one who is able to remain contented and joyful always. Contentment and joy are created and generated by the mind. Swamiji points out, that, if joy is a creation of the mind, then we must make our mind generate as much joy as one wants. This is called Yoga. Surrender also is another aspect of devotion. A seeker must offer his mind and intelligence to the Guru or the Lord.

So, all the exhortations of Sri Krishna are Sadhana relating to the mind and intelligence.

Shlokas chanted in the Track:

सन्तुष्टः सततं योगी यतात्मा दृढनिश्चयः ।
मय्यर्पितमनोबुद्धिर्यो मद्भक्तः स मे प्रियः ।।

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Swamiji urges us to think about the propositions of saakara, niraraka and nischala, spending time to understand them. It is by this that we will be able to increase our devotion.

Explaining a verse from Ashtavakra Samhita, Swamiji says that anything that has a shape or a form is to be considered as untrue, unreal. That which is devoid of shape is niścala, immovable, motionless. Only when one has spiritual instructions (Tattva Upadesha), one will not be born again.

Swamiji urges seekers to introspect on this one verse repeatedly.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this enlightening talk, Nutan Swamiji tells us that all strife we find in the society is due to our own selfishness, comptetition, jealousy etc. We think &#39;I&#39; is a body limited personality. That &#39;I&#39; is a ficticious &#39;I&#39;, we assume a certain image of ourselves. We have a bias and partiality in our vision. This constricted vision brings all strife in the society. 

But when we try to understand this &#39;I&#39;, looking within, we finally reach a state where there is nothing different from I. We find that the whole universe is floating in the I, sustained by the Consciousness. This experience is important in our life to remove all our misconceptions in a complete and wholesome manner.

			<title><![CDATA[Renunciation is Renouncing the Mind - Prabhatha Rashmih | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Through the conversation between Kumbha and the ascetic king Shikhidwaja, Swamiji explains what is ‘Renunciation’. He says Renunciation is of the mind – as everything is felt by the mind, experienced by the mind. The mind, being consciousness, has got infinite powers. By virtue of these powers, it produces the gross objects, preserves them and makes us experience them. Thus, everything is a mental creation – in the mind by the mind. It is such a mind that we have to renounce. Renouncing the mind means renouncing the ego, ‘I’ feeling. Ego is the seed from which the whole world tree is spreading forth.

The mind has the power and potential to produce and unproduce anything. Throughout the wakefulness, it spreads, extends and becomes, but at the end of the day it folds up into sleep, where there is no world, no ego is there. The world rises in the mind and sets in the mind. All the thoughts arise in the mind and also get dissolved into the mind.

We want to reach a state where the idea of a thought itself becomes a non-entity. The same mind which becomes doubtful, can be happy and clear. It is possible for us to use our discrimination to understand this wonderful Sadhana and be benefitted by it.

By virtue of these powers, it produces the gross objects, preserves them and makes us experience them. Thus, everything is a mental creation – in the mind by the mind.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this talk, Swamiji speaks comprehensively about our Mind, its power and potential. We suffer from ignorance or delusion about the self and our mind. This Ignorance is what is to be removed by proper pursuit of knowledge, by probing into the mind and intelligence and by enquiring about the Self.

What we need is a kind of mind in which all thoughts are always enlightening and informative and not affecting or agitating. By proper introspection, one must understand that mind and its thought are the same in substance. The thought is no different from the mind.

One must be able to delve into the thought process, mind process and understand that there is only one Presence there. A seeker must meditate only to recognize this one presence, exhorts Swamiji.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this audio, Swamiji says that the mind uses or employs the eyes to see the objects, to grasp them. At the grasping level, the mind is the source and cause. Then, after or in the grasping process, all the objects are imprinted by the mind itself. It is these imprints that one is experiencing.

Once this is understood – there will be Nirapeksha (non-expectation) in the mind. One will think: “Can my mind desire its own imprints? If everything is mental and mind born and mind imprint, then what is there to be desired?” Nirvikarah (unchanging) – one will understand that the mind cannot be affected by its own imprint? This kind of reflection makes the mind cool, comfortable, and calm.

Swamiji urges seekers to make the Buddhi deep and expansive. The only yearning in the mind must be to know the Self, one’s own real nature.

			<title><![CDATA[Affluence of the Mind - Prabhatha Rashmih | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this talk, Swamiji discusses Yogavasishtha Ramayana which tells us explicitly that the mind is an expression of the self. It is this mind that has to be tackled. Besides the mind, there is no other faculty a seeker has to focus his attention during the sadhana.

Mind has a number of traits likes- dislikes, preference-prejudices, acceptance-rejection, desire-hatred, which only cause us distress. The mind has great potential. Atma has to be known and accessed by the mind itself. A seeker has to introduce desirable qualities in the mind. When the mind has the noble qualities, it gets transformed.

Yoga Vasistha repeatedly stresses that one must be uniform with one’s own mind expressions. One must not prefer anything unduly, as a result of which one will dislike some other things. One must make the mind even and uniform in its responses, try to make it flexible and soft. So, one must treat the mind with a kind of universal evenness and fondness, treat it with a habit of tolerating, understanding and forbearing inputs from the world. If the mind becomes thinner, flexible, purer more and more sublime, one will start finding a contentment, fulfilment. The mind should be like an ocean which can withstand any waviness on the surface.

By truthful introspection, the mind can have poise, flexibility, expansion, depth, loftiness, a sense of affluence and sufficiency. Mental affluence makes one the richest man in the world. One can directly make the mind affluent, resourceful and sufficient.

			<title><![CDATA[Mind Is The Source Of Everything - Prabhatha Rashmih | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Swamiji clarifies that our mind is not a physical part of the body. It is associated with the body. Body is inert but mind and intelligence are not inert.

Our eyes are the smallest organs in our body, but they can see infinite distances. The power and presence that have made the eyes, the hands, skull and brain, its potential and greatness is infinite. When we refer to the mind and intelligence, we refer to the potential of this PRESENCE. One never sees the world outside. It is the mind that takes the mental imprint, and that imprint is what we experience. So, in the experience of the world, the mind is crucial.

The mind produces many thoughts, emotions, reactions, knowledge and doubts. All are mental products alone. Whatever the mind produces, they do not affect the mind. Every interaction produces only two impacts in the mind–pleasant-unpleasant, happiness-unhappiness. They are mind’s products and once they are assimilated by the mind, they cannot affect the mind.

Swamiji urges everyone to feel the presence of the mind, far more than the world outside. One must think about the mind, probe into it more and more. The three states, Sleep, dream and wakefulness, are also a product of mind.

They are initiated by the mind, then implemented by the mind by employing the senses and it also concludes in our mind.

Our human life is only meant to treat the mind and elevate it. One’s own mind and intelligence must be a very dependable friend and associate in life. For every problem sensed by the mind, the intelligence offers a solution.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Swamiji speaks about Sapta Bhumikas-the seven spiritual states of a seeker. It is not a physical growth, but a psycho-Intellectual growth of the seeker.

Both the mind and intelligence are expressions of the Consciousness. The consciousness employs the senses and employing the senses, it perceives. The actual perception is in the mind, registration is in the mind, imprints are in the mind, the mind uses the senses to have its own imprint and these imprints are stored. So, though it is a sensory experience, and we call it direct, the experience itself is in the level of consciousness.

After the mental imprints are made, mental role stops, and the intellectual role starts. The intelligence uses the mental data to think, to reason. As are the senses and sensory objects for the mind, so are the mental data, mental objects for the intelligence. But what functions as the intelligence is again consciousness. So, both the mental data and the intellectual finding data, are direct experiences.

			<title><![CDATA[Potential of the Mind - Prabhatha Rashmih | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Swamiji continues discussing the potential of the mind and asks us to keep introspecting on the mind such that knowledge becomes the functional note in our personality. Manana is the key.

The whole world is matter and energy and it is insentient. It is animated and activated by the Consciousness. Whether you call it the mind or the intelligence or the ego, substance-wise, it is the same cētana or consciousness.

cētana or consciousness is not just the mind that is enclosed within the body. Mind is only a functional name. One aspect of the cētana’s function is called the mind. But as a substance the mind refers to the cētana itself. Such a mind gets affected by interactional impacts only when we cannot extend the knowledge that that the mind is infinite and potent to these impacts. We think the impacts are more powerful than the mind. They are actually ripples and waves and the mind is the ocean.

A seeker must keep bringing the mind to the awareness and infusion of its potential whenever faced with agitations in interactions. Agitations are on the surface, and one must not get shaken by them. In reality, we are unaffected like the space, unshakeable like the mountains, and boundless like the ocean.

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Swamiji continues discussing the potential of the mind and asks us to keep introspecting on the mind such that knowledge becomes the functional note in our personality. Manana is the key.

The whole world is matter and energy and it is insentient. It is animated and activated by the Consciousness. Whether you call it the mind or the intelligence or the ego, substance-wise, it is the same cētana or consciousness.

cētana or consciousness is not just the mind that is enclosed within the body. Mind is only a functional name. One aspect of the cētana’s function is called the mind. But as a substance the mind refers to the cētana itself. Such a mind gets affected by interactional impacts only when we cannot extend the knowledge that that the mind is infinite and potent to these impacts. We think the impacts are more powerful than the mind. They are actually ripples and waves and the mind is the ocean.

A seeker must keep bringing the mind to the awareness and infusion of its potential whenever faced with agitations in interactions. Agitations are on the surface, and one must not get shaken by them. In reality, we are unaffected like the space, unshakeable like the mountains, and boundless like the ocean.

व्यवसायात्मिका बुद्धिरेकेह कुरुनन्दन ।
बहुशाखा ह्यनन्ताश्च बुद्धयोऽव्यवसायिनाम् ॥
Bhagavad Gita 2.41&lt;/p&gt;

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Nutan Swamiji enlightens us that though we see this world as external to us, in our experience the world we see is what appears in the mind. So, subjectively, the world we perceive is made of Consciousness. 
When thoughts arise, we get disturbed, as we follow the thoughts. Though it is the Consciousness, which is taking the forms that we are experiencing, we get troubled by the differential notion. Swamiji says, it is our clinging to what we like and dislike, that creates hindrance in making the Knowledge our own.

			<title><![CDATA[Doing all activities as Yajna | Words of Wisdom | Swamini Ma Gurupriya]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>What is Yajna? Ma explains that every act that we do without delusional clinging to the results, becomes a Yajna. We should consider every work as given by God and do it in an excellent manner. There should not be any thought of personal gain, rather we should think of others and do benevolent acts. 

Ma also tells us that it is easier to renounce external objects but our thoughts, feeling and ideas are very difficult to renounce. As we do our actions with the attitude of Yajna, it results in spiritual gain, our mind imbibes good qualities and becomes calm and quiet thereby leading us towards the final goal of Self-realization.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In the ancient times, the rishis used the &#39;arani&#39; wood to generate fire for their rituals, by rubbing the two pieces of wood together. Nutan Swamiji explains that the fire is already hidden in the wood, only a proper effort is needed to manifest it. Similarly, the Self is what we are, but we are unable to manifest or feel It, because our body and mind are so much given to worldly and sensory delight. 

A Guru helps us in experiencing the Self within us. The sadhana or churning has to be done using the Knowledge, which is the greatest purifier. Using the Knowledge as the tool, we have to relieve our mind and buddhi, which is currently sold to raga dvesha.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[The World Floats in Your Mind - Prabhatha Rashmih | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Swamiji says that spirituality is an experiential science. As perceivers, we give the objective reality to the world. The mind is subjective and all experiences are in this subjective sphere.

We perceive the earth, water etc. Similarly, we know that we have a body. This knowledge emerges inwardly in the mind. Just as light illumines objects, the ‘I’ illumines the presence of the body and the presence of the world.

Waking up, employing the senses and then perceiving the world – this perception is within the mental plane. The entire world is floating in our mind. In sleep this is confirmed repeatedly and the world is reduced to nothing.

This knowledge makes a man full, like the ocean with vastness and depth. This knowledge can become a source of abundance and enrichment, concludes Swamiji.

Shlokas chanted in the Track:

यथा प्रकाशयाम्येको देहमेनं तथा जगत् ।
Ashtavakra Samhita 2.2

अतो मम जगत्सर्वमथवा न च किंचन ।। २.२
मुनिः प्रसन्नगम्भीरो दुर्विगाह्यो दुरत्ययः ।
अनन्तपारो ह्यक्षोभ्यः स्तिमितोद इवार्णवः ।।

			<title><![CDATA[The Unfathomable Magnitude and Potential of the Mind - Prabhatha Rashmih | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Swamiji discusses the mind and reiterates the importance of introspection to understand its principles, processes, troubles and torments due to desires, hatred and other such emotions.

Mind is not just a flimsy, weak existence, it is potent powerful and resourceful. It produces millions of thoughts and also emotions. Thoughts are produced and dissolved over and over again. This twin process continues as long as the body remains.

Swamiji says that the mind is an expression of the soul. It has the power of creation and dissolution and thus it becomes virtually equal to God.

Mind is an expression of an infinitely complex entity and once we understand it, all torments subside. Swamiji urges us to rely upon the mind, support the mind, ask the mind to dissolve the agitations it has, and it will do so readily and willingly. The mind has the power and potential to assimilate anything. A seeker only needs to understand it.</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Swamiji discusses the mind and reiterates the importance of introspection to understand its principles, processes, troubles and torments due to desires, hatred and other such emotions.

Mind is not just a flimsy, weak existence, it is potent powerful and resourceful. It produces millions of thoughts and also emotions. Thoughts are produced and dissolved over and over again. This twin process continues as long as the body remains.

Swamiji says that the mind is an expression of the soul. It has the power of creation and dissolution and thus it becomes virtually equal to God.

Mind is an expression of an infinitely complex entity and once we understand it, all torments subside. Swamiji urges us to rely upon the mind, support the mind, ask the mind to dissolve the agitations it has, and it will do so readily and willingly. The mind has the power and potential to assimilate anything. A seeker only needs to understand it.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Probe into your Thoughts Through Meditation - Prabhatha Rashmih | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this talk, Swamiji discusses the benefit of a spiritual life and pursuit. Spirituality offers an inner gain, after attaining which, the spiritual seeker feels that there is nothing greater than that.

The spiritual gain is felt in the sphere of the mind. The only way is to sit and delve into our minds. The gain belongs to the mind and intelligence.

For some time daily, we must get into our mind and probe into its thoughts. Our mind is a wonderful source which can generate any number of thoughts, preserve them, and dissolve them too. Swamiji urges us to introspect on the workings of the mind and the origin of thoughts. One must sit in a place, close one’s eyes, be relaxed and get into the company of the mind and thoughts.

Every thought must be evaluated preserved or disposed off only after we spend time on it. Through this process, the thinking will get filtered, reformed and refined. Mind is a gift, a treasure. We must spend time with it and recognize it. One must go into its nature, its qualities, by the process of meditation. One must plunge into the mind and become more familiar with our inner personality and this meditation leads to integration of the personality.

Meditation can be attempted by everyone. It is the only way to get into our inner personality and bring about whatever enrichments and elevations we need and want.

Shlokas chanted in the track:

यं लब्ध्वा चापरं लाभं मन्यते नाधिकं ततः ।

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Activities and achievements in the world are traceable to the human mind. Sharing the examples of poets like Kalidasa.

One has the power to transform the mind and intelligence. Even Panini worked on his mind and got clue to compose the sutras on Sanskrit grammar. Kalidasa transformed his own life and became a renowned Poet. Meera physically drank poison but there was no effect on her body. This is the power of mind over matter.

Deeksha help a seeker to cling to a word, a sutra and invigorate the mind with it. This is one’s greatest austerity. Mind becomes active, convergence happens, and it gets more and more centric. Application by itself on itself is the only way.

			<title><![CDATA[Ramayana and Hindu Dharma - Prabhatha Rashmih | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Swamiji details how the Epics are not mere historical descriptions, but actually give through them, the values and inspiring lives of all the characters. Ramayana was composed by Sage Valmiki, who got transformed from the dacoit Ratnakara into a saint. Through the close association of the saints, he got free from all his sins. Through the poetic composition of the Ramayana, Sage Valmiki depicts the life of Maryada Purusha Shree Rama as well as all the characters in the kingdom of Ayodhya during the Treta Yuga.

Swamiji speaks about the degradation of this lofty Dharma of our country today. There are malpractices in the temples and other religious worships. Various practices are polluting the minds and the society at large, instead of making people inculcate purity through the devotional practices. In this talk, Swamiji gives a clarion call not to fall a trap to these wrong doings in the name of devotion.

Shlokas chanted in the Track:

यत् क्रौञ्चमिथुनादेकमवधीः काममोहितम् ।।

			<title><![CDATA[Understanding the Mind - Prabhatha Rashmih | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Spirituality is a mental pursuit. The only focus in on the mind, says Swamiji.

Mind is either functional or non-functional and the entire sadhana is to deal with the functional mind and reach the non-functional state. From active to still. A thought-free state doesn’t stay forever, and we return to a thoughtful state. The goal is that the thoughtful state should not disturb us. We should be the same in both.

First, we reach a thought-free fullness and thereafter we must progress to a state in which both the still and vibrant states are alike.

Yoga Vasistha says: Lead the mind to samadhi. Ultimately overcome the state of samadhi and asamadhi and be equally at home with both. This is a lofty state where opulence and poverty do not delude us, strength and weakness cannot dislodge us and attainment and unattainment cannot subdue us.

Shlokas chanted in the Track:
यथा वासनया तज्ज्ञा विहरन्तीह कर्मसु ।
तां त्वं सत्त्वाभिधां विद्धि पुनर्जननवर्जिताम् ।।
(Yogavasishtha 6.101.52)

अथ चेतसि तत्त्वज्ञ स्पन्दास्पन्दौ त्वमेकताम् ।
नीत्वा तिष्ठ यथाकाममैक्यमागत्य शाश्वतम् ।।

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Swamiji asks us to evaluate why this world is considered to be mithya, even though everything around us seems to be solid. Our mind refuses to accept that it is a illusion unless we assess it from our intelligence level.

Experiences are all inner. The subtle mind makes us experiences everything. All experiences are caused by the senses, which are activated by the mind. All gross objects derive their existence because the mind experiences them.

All 3 dimensions are produced by the mind and that’s how we experience the gross objects. This entire world that we experience in our mind, can never be a factual reality but an imaginary entity. The mystery of the mind is a fact of our existence. Swamiji urges us all to think and ponder on this as he ends this wonderful talk.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Purity of Mind - Prabhatha Rashmih | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Poojya Swamiji says that the mind is of 2 types – pure and impure. The same mind becomes pure and impure.

The excessive attachment to the sensory objects of the world leading to sensory enjoyments conduces to bondage. The mind keeps struggling and cannot be contented and quiet. When the mind is free from their stranglehold, then it is said to be free.

How to make the mind pure? A seeker must focus on removing the impurity and restoring purity. Contentment and joy as much as sorrow belong only to the mind, as they are experiences produced by the mind.

Swamiji elaborates that the mind, intelligence and ego get purified by beautiful narrations like the Srimad Bhagavatam, listening to these holy stories, chanting the names of God. To the extent we are purified, to the same degree we are able to perceive the self.

			<title><![CDATA[There is no Bondage - Prabhatha Rashmih | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Swamiji, in this track, speaks about bondage and liberation. We are bound and this bondage has to be removed. The whole Ātma jñāna sādhana is meant for that.

The Upanishads say the Ātma is eternally free. It has got no bondage at all. A seeker must understand the nature and character of the soul and know it to be sentient and spatial. Being so, it cannot court any bondage, any time. So, it is not the question of acquiring of liberation, but the understanding that there is no bondage. Understanding that there is no bondage, is true liberation.

			<title><![CDATA[Mind Can Dissolve All Mental Impacts - Prabhatha Rashmih | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this audio, Swamiji points out that the skill and ability of the mind is limitless. Mind is capable of assimilating any kind of an impact from the world. The mind will dissolve only mental impacts and these impacts are made by the mind, not by any object. Mind alone sees the world. Mind alone forges an imprint on it and mind alone feels the impact. So, everything is the mind and mind alone is the sole focus of spiritual wisdom.

The more assimilative the mind becomes, more the structure of the mind will change. The seeker must always strive to nurture and develop the mind. There are only two skills needed to live successfully in the world: 1) To assimilate all impacts from the world and 2) To generate all necessary outputs from the mind,</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Four Levels of Activity - Prabhatha Rashmih | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Human activity is primarily in four levels, says Swamiji in this track. The first is the physical level where activity is performed with the body, limbs and sensory organs. Next is the oral activity where sounds are produced. Superior to these external activities is the mental activity where the thinking, remembering etc are done by the mind. Still higher and deeper is the activity done by the intelligence where there is a quest for knowledge.

Swamiji exhorts all seekers to evaluate and understand the two inner activities–the activities performed by the mind and intelligence. They constitute the deepest and loftiest levels of activity which have a transforming effect on the personality of the seeker.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Mind and the Self - Prabhatha Rashmih | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this message, Swamiji says that all actions are initiated by the mind, sustained by the mind and dissolved by the mind. So, mind is the sole focus of an individual’s life.

Normally, the mind is outgoing. This outgoing tendency has to be avoided and the seeker must make an effort to rest the mind on the Self. When the mind rests on the Self, it will slowly give up desires for external objects. When the mind becomes free of external desires, the Self experience one has will not be limited to meditational hours but it will extend to all activities and interactions.

Shlokas chanted in the Track:

यथा यथा प्रत्यगवस्थितं मनः
तथा तथा मुञ्चति बाह्यवासनाम् ।
निःशेषमोक्षे सति वासनानां
आत्मानुभूतिः प्रतिबन्धशून्या ॥

(Vivekacūḍāmaṇiḥ 276)</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Unaffected Nature of the Mind - Prabhatha Rashmih | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this message, Swamiji urges seekers to understand that the focus of spirituality is the ‘Mind’. By any extent of mind’s productions, the mind substance is not affected.

One has to sit and observe the mind and understand that any kind of a mental activity does not bring about a structural change in the mind. The mind presence continues to be the same.

Remaining silent in oneself, one can feel the presence of the mind and realize that no function of the mind affects the mind itself. Realizing this unaffected nature of the mind, one must remain unaffected. The entire sadhana is to gain this wonderful position of enlightenment, stability and steadiness.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this audio, Swamiji exhorts all seekers to be at home with everything that happens in life.

Maybe in the past sins or mistakes were committed but one should not worry about it. One must have a light mind. One must not magnify any troubles or irritations. Our mind has got full capacity to be at home with everything, either past, present, or future. It is the mind that has to reconcile with whatever has taken place or is going to take place. Our mind has got sufficient potential for that. One must have faith and remain unruffled. A seeker needs to keep developing the right knowledge, devotion and sublimity.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[No Thought is besides and different from the Mind - Prabhatha Rashmih | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this talk, Swamiji discusses and explains the three levels of Reality–Vyāvahārika (Interactional), Prātibhāsika (illusory) and Pāramārthika. All the three are there concurrently or parallel in us. When we are wakeful it is Vyāvahārika reality, when we are dreaming it is illusory reality, and when we are able to understand it fully it becomes the real reality.

In the Vyāvahārika level things are different from us and plurality is there. In the dream, difference is there but it is in an illusory manner and when one understands the Truth in the level of the intelligence, he will find that all are but one and one alone is.

Shlokas chanted in the Track:

एकं रूपं बहुधा यः करोति

Our real personality is the mento-intellectual one. So, all the reformation, enrichment and refinement have to be brought about in the mind and the intelligence.

A seeker wanting to have freedom and fulfilment, will have to improve and nourish the mind and intelligence. This refinement and enrichment cannot be had by any external rituals or practices.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this message, Swamiji speaks about Hindu Dharma and the two personalities around whom it prevails. One is Sri Rama and the other is Sri Krishna. In Sri Rama’s life, we find that the greatness of the human mind consists in the sacrifice it is able to generate.

Sri Krishna repeatedly emphasizes to Uddhava (In Srimad Bhagavatam) that the whole world is nothing but a display of the mind. The prime emphasis of his teaching is on the illusory nature of the world. Everything is the mind display, and mind itself is an expression of consciousness. This consciousness is the Supreme truth, and that alone is God.</p>

Knowledge of the mind and intelligence and their function is the Subject Knowledge. In subject knowledge, we aim to enhance the skill, the ability, the performance of the mind and the intelligence.

How to improve the mind and intelligence? The mind is nourished and improved, when we incorporate desirable qualities and eliminate undesirable qualities. To nourish the intelligence, one has to develop the art of introspection.

			<title><![CDATA[Culturing a Buoyant Mind - Prabhatha Rashmih | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this talk, Poojya Swamiji takes up the subject of the potential of the mind. We all have things in our past which have the capacity to hurt or victimize us in the present. By the right thought process, by the right emotional process, by the right spiritual process, all that can be simply dropped and the mind can start becoming lustrous and brilliant. One is not to be victimized by the memory of the past; one has to be encouraged by the possibility of the present.

Swamiji emphasizes that If one wants to get into the actual sādhanā, one has to penetrate into the mind. You can think, “Any kind of a past I have, I will simply dispossess it. I will develop and culture a new present, a new mind.”</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Imbibe Qualities to Make Your Mind Flexible - Prabhatha Rashmih | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>The entire spirituality is mind-centered, says Swamiji. One has to constantly try improving the mind, building and imbuing the mind with newer and newer qualities.

When the mind cultivates qualties such as love, sympathy, sacrifice etc, it will become vast and expansive. Mind is currently inflexible and hard. The same mind can be made flexible, spatial, ready to assimiate all interactional impacts.

Shlokas chanted in this audio:

आकाशवल्लेपविदूरगोऽहं
आदित्यवद्भास्यविलक्षणोऽहम् ।
अहार्यवन्नित्यविनिश्चलोऽहं
अम्भोधिवत्पारविवर्जितोऽहम् ॥

			<title><![CDATA[Sadhana for wholesomeness and fulfilment - Prabhatha Rashmih | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Analyzing the inner personality, Swamiji explains that our personality consists of the mind, intelligence, ego and the substratum of all these–the SELF. With such a personality we are complete, full and wholesome. To understand that this is so and to make our mind and intelligence reflect the fullness and wholesomeness is the real effort and sādhanā.

We have to understand that the whole of spiritual sadhana is centered in the mind. It is the mind that begets experience, it is the mind that distorts matters, and it is the mind that becomes pure and brings clarity.

Shlokas chanted in the track:

मय्येव मन आधत्स्व मयि बुद्धिं निवेशय ।
निवसिष्यसि मय्येव अत ऊर्ध्वं न संशयः ।।
Bhagavad Gita–12.8

			<title><![CDATA[Solution lies within - Prabhatha Rashmih | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this track, Poojya Swamiji speaks on how a seeker should approach every challenge in life. One has to elevate oneself from emotional turbulence to rational enquiry–from the mind level to the intelligence level.

For every problem, there is a solution right beneath the problem in the inner recess of the mind itself. If there is a problem, there is also a solution. If there is no solution, at least there is a dissolution of the problem. The whole process revolves around our own inner personality.

Shlokas chanted in this track:

The problem is that we are not conscious of the fact that it is the mind that is to be handled. A seeker has to integrate mind’s own products and reactions. Any kind of a spiritual seeking and a spiritual effort will be an effort to look into the mind and make its reactions uniform, without swinging between likes and dislikes, loss and gain etc.</p>

The problem is that we are not conscious of the fact that it is the mind that is to be handled. A seeker has to integrate mind’s own products and reactions. Any kind of a spiritual seeking and a spiritual effort will be an effort to look into the mind and make its reactions uniform, without swinging between likes and dislikes, loss and gain etc.&lt;/p&gt;

His will be a public life, he would meet and interact with many people, places and situations. In all his interactions, he neither gets attached to anything nor does he get detached from anything. He is established in the middle position.
Swamiji exhorts listerners to stay focussed on the middle position. This middle position, self-postion, is so beautiful that one starts becoming harmonious with the world, integral with the world. Our spiritual attainment is not something to be had by being away from the world but by practicing ‘away-ness’ in the world itself.

Shlokas chanted in the audio:

न खिद्यते नो विषयैः प्रमोदते
न सज्जते नापि विरज्यते च ।
स्वस्मिन्सदा क्रीडति नन्दति स्वयं
निरन्तरानन्दरसेन तृप्तः ।।

(Vivekacūḍāmaṇiḥ 536)</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Seek Contentment from the Mind Alone - Prabhatha Rashmih]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>It is foolishness to think that any object can create joy. Is joy not an inner creation of the mind alone? If we churn our mind with this knowledge, then undue elation and undue depression will both fled, and the contentment we seek, becomes ours.

Slokas chanted in the track:

मात्रास्पर्शास्तु कौन्तेय शीतोष्णसुखदुःखदाः ।
आगमापायिनोऽनित्यास्तांस्तितिक्षस्व भारत ।।
(Bhagavad Gita 2.14)

इन्द्रियस्येन्द्रियस्यार्थे रागद्वेषौ व्यवस्थितौ ।
तयोर्न वशमागच्छेत्तौ ह्यस्य परिपन्थिनौ ।।
(Bhagavad Gita 3.34)

न प्रहृष्येत्प्रियं प्राप्य नोद्विजेत्प्राप्य चाप्रियम् ।
स्थिरबुद्धिरसम्मूढो ब्रह्मविद् ब्रह्मणि स्थितः ।।
(Bhagavad Gita 5.20)

कामक्रोधवियुक्तानां यतीनां यतचेतसाम् ।
अभितो ब्रह्मनिर्वाणं वर्तते विदितात्मनाम् ।।
(Bhagavad Gita 5.26)</p>

The activities maybe in the domestic, professional or the social field but one must make all activities spiritual and divine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The formula is to drop all aspirations, desires, ideals and values and focus on doing all activities joyfully, happily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shlokas chanted in the audio:&lt;br&gt;ज्ञानं ज्ञेयं ज्ञानगम्यं&lt;br&gt;(Bhagavad Gita 13.17)&lt;br&gt;यया संलभते रतिम्&lt;br&gt;(Srimad Bhagavatam 7.7.33)&lt;br&gt;तद्विद्धि प्रणिपातेन परिप्रश्नेन सेवया ।&lt;br&gt;उपदेक्ष्यन्ति ते ज्ञानं ज्ञानिनस्तत्त्वदर्शिनः ।।&lt;br&gt;(Bhagavad Gita 4.34)&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[What is Liberation? - Prabhata Rashmih | Swami Bhoomananda Tirtha]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Poojya Swamiji gives the listener a fresh insight into the subject of liberation. When one is free, light and unaffected, it is liberation.
Liberation does not mean that one has to get liberated. Liberation is in feeling that the ‘I’ in me has been ever-liberated. One has to feel one’s own liberated nature. It is not to attain any particular state but to know what is already there.
Quoting a verse from Srimad Bhagavatam, Swamiji explains that terms like bondage and liberation are only in the realm of Gunas. But Gunas being illusory in nature, bondage and liberation are also illusory.
Verses chanted in the talk:

बद्धो मुक्त इति व्याख्या गुणतो मे न वस्तुत: ।
गुणस्य मायामूलत्वान्न मे मोक्षो न बन्धनम् ॥

Srimad Bhagavatam–11.11.1

The society is complex, and we have to live in it. There will be the gravest of conflicts and contradictions. Swamiji says that being the case, we cannot be held responsible for the present plight, but we are certainly responsible to handle it and go forward. What is the way?
